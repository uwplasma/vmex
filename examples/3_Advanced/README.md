# 3_Advanced examples

These scripts are intended for advanced use:

- longer runs,
- optimization / inverse problems,
- performance profiling,
- experimental features.

Most scripts in this folder will likely require optional dependencies.

Notes:
- Use `--jit-grad` only once you’re iterating repeatedly with fixed shapes (it increases compile latency).
- For early solver experiments, try `--preconditioner mode_diag`.
