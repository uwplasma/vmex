"""Polish the bundled shaped tokamak and compare the exported WOUT files.

VMEX first converges the ordinary VMEC discretization.  The optional polish
then solves the higher-order strong force-balance residual and certifies the
result with independent force, radial-refinement, and positive-Jacobian
checks.  A certified equilibrium is exported by sampling the native state on
a denser radial mesh, where the WOUT reconstruction can carry the polish
gain; ``solve_file`` writes that file directly.
