# Examples

All runnable examples live under this single `examples/` tree.

- Top-level scripts demonstrate common workflows (start with
  `fixed_boundary_run.py`):
  - `fixed_boundary_run.py` — read `&INDATA`, converge, write/plot the wout.
  - `plot_and_boozer.py` — every built-in `plot_wout` figure plus the Boozer
    transform (`run_booz_xform` + `plot_boozmn`) on one converged equilibrium.
  - `plot_optimized_families.py` — README composites for optimized QA/QH/QP
    outputs and the bundled NFP=1--4 QI inputs: four toroidal cuts, 3-D LCFS,
    and LCFS `|B|` in Boozer coordinates.
  - `profiles_power_and_spline.py` — the same equilibrium from power-series and
    cubic-spline pressure/iota profiles (they agree); `NCURR=0` vs `NCURR=1`.
  - `run_from_json.py` — read/convert structured JSON (`to_json` /
    `from_file`); the JSON and `&INDATA` forms describe one equilibrium.
  - `hot_restart_scan.py` — seed each scan point from the previous converged
    state; warm restarts converge in ~1 iteration and recompile nothing.
  - `finite_beta_scan.py` — ramp the pressure (hot-restarted) and read beta,
    the Shafranov shift (magnetic-axis motion), and Mercier `DMerc` stability.
  - `parallel_ensemble_scan.py` — solve an ensemble of independent equilibria
    concurrently on CPU (`vmex.parallel.solve_ensemble`); prints the measured
    strong-scaling curve and checks the results are bit-identical to serial.
  - `take_gradients.py` — exact fixed-boundary gradients of wout scalars
    (aspect, magnetic energy, ...) by implicit differentiation, checked against
    finite differences; O(1) memory, no step size to tune.
  - `free_boundary_mgrid.py` — free-boundary equilibrium from coil currents and
    an mgrid vacuum field (NESTOR); the LCFS is solved for, not prescribed.
  - `free_boundary_beta_scan.py` — ramp the pressure of the free-boundary case
    (coil currents fixed); the LCFS is re-solved by NESTOR at each beta.
  - `free_boundary_essos_coils.py` — free-boundary beta scan directly from
    ESSOS coils (tabulated to a temporary mgrid); `PRES_SCALE` is calibrated per point so the
    *actual* wout `betatotal` hits 0/1/2/3 %.
  - `take_free_boundary_gradients.py` — differentiate the reconverged coupled
    NESTOR--VMEX root with respect to a direct ESSOS coil field, and compare
    the adjoint with independent re-solves.
  - `vmex_get_B_gradB.py` and `vmex_get_B_outside_plasma.py` — query a
    finite-beta field inside the LCFS or an actual ESSOS coil plus
    virtual-casing field outside it, including three spatial derivative orders
    and exact VJPs in named VMEX/ESSOS variables.
  - `vmex_fieldline_tracing_vacuum.py` and
    `vmex_fieldline_tracing_finite_beta.py` — compare VMEX, coil-only, and
    self-consistent exterior traces in 3-D and toroidal Poincare plots.
    Seeds form one line from the regularized magnetic axis through the
    selected exterior offset; VMEX uses toroidal angle while Cartesian traces use arclength and
    stop after leaving the LCFS neighborhood.
    The finite-beta coil fixture is reproduced by ESSOS
    `examples/coil_optimization/optimize_coils_finite_beta_vmex.py`.
  - `vmex_fixed_free_boundary_comparison.py` — solve a larger coil-driven free
    boundary, restrict its exact `s=0.5` surface and profiles to a fixed solve,
    refit the four ESSOS coil currents with virtual casing, and compare eleven
    parent surfaces plus the exterior field. The plot also exposes the physical
    difference caused by removing the parent equilibrium's outer plasma current.
- `optimization/`: compact QA/QH/QP/QI scripts using `(function, target,
  weight)` terms with SciPy least-squares, BFGS, or L-BFGS-B. The fixed-boundary
  `single_stage_optimization.py` jointly varies VMEX boundary coefficients and
  ESSOS coil Fourier coefficients; no free-boundary solve is involved.
  `QA_optimization_bootstrap.py` and `QH_optimization_bootstrap.py` also vary
  a stage-refined current spline against self-consistent Redl, DMerc, and DR
  targets. `single_stage_optimization_finite_beta.py` combines that finite-beta
  plasma problem with exact virtual-casing and ESSOS coil derivatives.
  `single_stage_free_boundary_optimization.py` and its finite-beta counterpart
  instead leave the LCFS implicit and vary only ESSOS coil shape/current dofs
  through the experimental coupled NESTOR adjoint, without an mgrid file.
  `QA_optimization_DMerc_vacuum.py` screens a vacuum candidate with the
  frozen-geometry pressure proxies before re-solving at finite pressure, and
  `QA_optimization_global.py` explores basins with SciPy basin hopping before
  the exact least-squares finish.
  All read `VMEX_EXAMPLES_CI=1` for short CI smoke tests.
- `optimization/stellarator_asymmetry/`: the same four families with
  `lasym = True`, seeding `RBS(1,1)`/`ZBC(1,1)` so the optimizer starts off the
  stellarator-symmetric stationary subspace. Each has a finite-beta companion
  that adds Mercier and resistive-interchange rows on a radially graded weight.
  The asymmetric boundary doubles the decision variables, so a stage costs
  roughly twice its symmetric equivalent.
- `optimization/QA_maxJ_continuation.py` and `QI_maxJ_continuation.py` walk the
  constructed maximum-J target into the resolved certificate; the QA script
  states where maximum-J and quasisymmetry conflict near the axis.
- `epsilon_effective.py` computes the NEO_JAX effective ripple from a solved
  equilibrium without writing a `boozmn` file; raise its `NeoConfig` controls
  for anything beyond a radial trend.
- `mirror/mirror_fixed_boundary_nonaxisymmetric.py` compares axisymmetric and
  rotating-ellipse fixed-boundary mirrors; `mirror/mirror_free_boundary_beta_scan.py`
  continues a solved ESSOS-coil free boundary through 80% central beta and
  compares its on-axis field with `sqrt(1-beta)`.
- `data/`: bundled input decks and small checked-in fixtures.
- `data/single_grid/`: fixed-boundary single-grid benchmark inputs and optional
  fetched reference assets.

Generated outputs should go to ignored `results/`, `outputs/`, or a user-chosen
directory.  Do not commit generated WOUT, mgrid, Boozer, PDF, or plot files
unless they are compact reviewed documentation artifacts.

Published-equilibrium comparisons and reproducibility studies belong in
`../benchmarks/`, not among the user-facing optimization examples.
