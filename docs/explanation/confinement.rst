Confinement physics: quasisymmetry, omnigenity, stability
=========================================================

The pages :doc:`variational-problem` and :doc:`iteration` derive the *solver* physics —
the energy functional whose stationary point is an equilibrium, and the
numerics that find it. This page derives the **target functionals** that a
stellarator-design campaign puts in front of that equilibrium: the confinement
and stability metrics of :mod:`vmex.core.omnigenity`,
:mod:`vmex.core.optimize`, :mod:`vmex.core.nyquist`,
:mod:`vmex.core.stability` and :mod:`vmex.core.bootstrap`. It is the
first-principles companion to :doc:`/reference/objectives`, which catalogs the same
quantities as ready-to-use optimizer terms.

The unifying object is the field strength :math:`|B|` expressed in **Boozer
coordinates**: quasisymmetry, omnigenity, and the neoclassical transport that
they control are all statements about the angular structure of :math:`|B|` at
fixed flux label, and are cleanest in the coordinates in which field lines are
straight *and* the parallel current is a flux function.

Boozer coordinates
------------------

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Guiding-center orbits — and therefore neoclassical transport, fast-ion
confinement, and the bootstrap current — depend on the magnetic geometry almost
entirely through the variation of :math:`|B|` along and across field lines.
Boozer coordinates :math:`(s, \theta_B, \zeta_B)` are the flux coordinates that
make this variation maximally transparent: field lines are straight,

.. math::

   \frac{d\theta_B}{d\zeta_B} = \iota(s),

and the covariant representation of :math:`\mathbf B` collapses to the two
surface functions

.. math::

   \mathbf B = \nabla\psi\times\nabla\theta_B + \iota\,\nabla\zeta_B\times\nabla\psi
             = I(s)\,\nabla\theta_B + G(s)\,\nabla\zeta_B + \beta_*\,\nabla\psi,

where :math:`2\pi I(s)` is the toroidal current inside :math:`s`, :math:`2\pi
G(s)` the poloidal current outside it (VMEC's ``buco`` and ``bvco``,
:func:`~vmex.core.fields.surface_currents`), and :math:`\psi=\Phi/2\pi` is
the toroidal flux per radian. Because :math:`I` and :math:`G` are flux
functions, the magnetic differential equation for the coordinate shift is
linear and can be solved surface by surface.

Construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from the straight-field-line (VMEC) angles :math:`(\theta,\zeta)` with
the renormalized poloidal angle :math:`u=\theta+\lambda`, the Boozer angles
differ by a single periodic scalar :math:`\nu(s,\theta,\zeta)`:

.. math::

   \theta_B = \theta + \lambda + \iota\,\nu, \qquad
   \zeta_B  = \zeta + \nu .

The shift :math:`\nu` follows from the covariant field. Introduce the periodic
part :math:`w` of the Boozer generating potential, fixed by

.. math::

   \frac{\partial w}{\partial\theta} = B_\theta, \qquad
   \frac{\partial w}{\partial\zeta}  = B_\zeta,

with :math:`B_\theta,B_\zeta` the covariant components on the surface
(:func:`~vmex.core.fields.magnetic_fields`). In
:func:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.boozer_bmnc_state` this is inverted
spectrally: after an FFT, the non-axisymmetric (:math:`m\ne 0`) harmonics of
:math:`w` come from :math:`B_\theta` and the axisymmetric (:math:`m=0`)
harmonics from :math:`B_\zeta`, matching the mode split of the Fortran
``booz_xform``. The coordinate shift is then

.. math::

   \nu = \frac{w - I(s)\,\lambda}{G(s) + \iota(s)\,I(s)} .

Finally the Boozer :math:`|B|` spectrum is obtained by the angle-transform
quadrature, weighting :math:`|B|` (evaluated on the VMEC grid) by the Jacobian
of the angle map:

.. math::

   \hat B^{B}_{mn}(s) = \Bigl\langle\,|B|\,
      \cos\!\bigl(m\,\theta_B - n\,\zeta_B\bigr)\,
      \frac{\partial(\theta_B,\zeta_B)}{\partial(\theta,\zeta)}\Bigr\rangle,

the angle bracket being the surface average over the original
:math:`(\theta,\zeta)` grid. These are the ``bmnc_b`` coefficients (physical
mode numbers ``xm_b``, ``xn_b``) consumed by every metric below.

Two implementations share these equations. The host driver
:func:`vmex.core.boozer.run_booz_xform` calls ``booz_xform_jax`` on a
``wout_*.nc`` file and writes a standard ``boozmn_*.nc`` (used by ``vmec
--booz`` and by :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.quasi_isodynamic_residual_from_wout`).
The traceable :func:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.boozer_bmnc_state` evaluates the
*same* transform in pure ``jax.numpy`` directly from the solver's internal
half-mesh field tables, so the Boozer spectrum — and any metric built on it —
carries exact implicit gradients. The two agree to :math:`\sim10^{-6}` on the
dominant modes.


Quasisymmetry
-------------

Confinement rationale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A field is **quasisymmetric** when :math:`|B|` depends on the two Boozer angles
only through a single linear combination,

.. math::

   |B| = |B|\bigl(s,\; M\theta_B - N\zeta_B\bigr),

for a fixed integer helicity :math:`(M,N)`. The magnitude, not the vector
field, need only be symmetric: this is enough for the guiding-center Lagrangian
to acquire an ignorable angle, hence a conserved canonical momentum and confined
collisionless orbits — the same confinement a true axisymmetric tokamak enjoys,
but in a compact 3D device. The helicity fixes the family
(:class:`~vmex.core.optimize.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`, ``helicity_n`` in
units of ``nfp``):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 20 54

   * - family
     - :math:`(M,N)`
     - :math:`|B|` contours in Boozer angles
   * - QA (quasi-axisymmetric)
     - :math:`(1,0)`
     - close poloidally (tokamak-like)
   * - QH (quasi-helical)
     - :math:`(1,\pm\mathrm{nfp})`
     - close helically
   * - QP (quasi-poloidal)
     - :math:`(0,1)`
     - close toroidally

The two-term residual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rather than Fourier-filter the Boozer spectrum, ``vmex`` uses the
Landreman–Paul *two-term* local residual, which is an exact pointwise
diagnostic of the same condition and needs no mode truncation. On each
requested surface, sampled on a uniform :math:`(\theta,\phi)` grid,

.. math::

   f_{\mathrm{QS}} =
   \frac{(\mathbf B\times\nabla B\cdot\nabla\psi)\,(N-\iota M)
       - (\mathbf B\cdot\nabla B)\,(M G + N I)}{B^{3}},

with :math:`M=` ``helicity_m``, :math:`N=` ``helicity_n``\ :math:`\times`\
``nfp``, and :math:`G,I` the Boozer covariant averages ``bvco``/``buco``. The
key algebraic fact is that :math:`f_{\mathrm{QS}}` **vanishes identically iff**
:math:`|B|` is quasisymmetric with helicity :math:`(M,N)`; there is no residual
symmetry-breaking harmonic left to penalize. The flux-surface sum
:math:`\sum f_{\mathrm{QS}}^2`, weighted by the surface measure
:math:`\sqrt{\mathrm{nfp}\,\Delta\theta\,\Delta\phi\,|\sqrt g|/V'}`, reproduces
simsopt's ``QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`` A/B bit-for-bit. Kept in
Gauss–Newton (per-point) form, it feeds the least-squares driver as an exact
residual vector rather than a pre-summed scalar. The metric is evaluated from
the parity-proven wout tables (:mod:`vmex.core.nyquist`) and also exposes a
traceable ``residuals_state`` lane, so the *same* term optimizes under both
``jac=None`` and ``jac="implicit"`` (see :doc:`/reference/objectives`).


Omnigenity and quasi-isodynamicity
----------------------------------

Omnigenity generalizes quasisymmetry: it asks only that the **bounce-averaged
radial drift of trapped particles vanish**, without requiring a symmetry of
:math:`|B|`. Equivalently (Cary & Shasharina 1997), the second adiabatic
invariant

.. math::

   \mathcal J_\parallel(s,\alpha;B^*) = \oint v_\parallel\,d\ell,
   \qquad v_\parallel \propto \sqrt{1 - B/B^*},

is a flux function — independent of the field-line label :math:`\alpha` at every
trapping level :math:`B^*`. Every quasisymmetric field is omnigenous; the
converse is not true, which leaves omnigenity the larger (and for
poloidally-closed contours, bootstrap-suppressing) design space. A **quasi-
isodynamic** (QI) field is an omnigenous field whose :math:`|B|` contours close
**poloidally** (:math:`M=0`), so that the trapped-particle precession is purely
poloidal and the bootstrap current is small by construction — the target of the
nfp1–nfp4 decks in ``examples/data/``.

Bounce action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:func:`vmex.core.bounce.bounce_action` evaluates the physical-pitch form

.. math::

   \mathcal J_\parallel
   = 2\int_{\ell_1}^{\ell_2}\sqrt{1-\lambda B}\,d\ell

for every complete magnetic well in a sampled field line. The factor two
closes the bounce orbit; multiply by the chosen reference speed for a
dimensional invariant. Crossings and wells retain fixed array shapes, while a
sine-mapped Gauss--Legendre rule removes the square-root singularity at each
bounce point. Invalid slots are NaN and carry explicit absent, marginal,
merged, truncated, and overflow masks.

:func:`vmex.core.bounce.bounce_action_from_boozer` synthesizes field lines from
``booz_xform``-convention harmonics. It uses
:math:`d\ell/d\zeta_B=|G+\iota I|/B`, so pitch values are shared physical
values rather than separately normalized levels. Both entry points support
JIT, forward AD, and reverse AD. Derivatives are defined within a fixed well
topology; marginal and merged masks identify topology changes that an
optimizer must exclude or resolve.

The ``--plot`` polar diagnostic instead holds the normalized trapping class
:math:`\lambda_n` fixed across radius,
:math:`1/\lambda=B_{\min}(s)+\lambda_n[B_{\max}(s)-B_{\min}(s)]`, following
Rodríguez, Helander & Goodman (2024). It plots
:math:`x=s\cos\alpha`, :math:`y=s\sin\alpha`; an omnigenous field therefore
has concentric circular contours. This display convention does not change the
physical-pitch contract of the optimization objectives.

The constructed-QI target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because :math:`\mathcal J_\parallel` uniformity is awkward to differentiate,
:class:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.QIResidual` implements a lightweight smooth
surrogate distilled from level-set conditions used by the
*constructed-QI-target* method of Goodman *et al.* (2023). On each surface,
:math:`|B|` is sampled along Boozer field lines
:math:`\theta_B=\alpha+\iota\phi_B` over one field period, and three families of
residual — each an **exact zero of an exactly QI field** — are stacked:

* **Bounce-distance uniformity** (``well_weight``). For every trapping level
  :math:`B^*`, the distance :math:`\delta(\alpha,B^*)` between the two monotone
  branches of the magnetic well, minus its field-line average. This is the
  Cary–Shasharina condition (constant well width at fixed :math:`B^*` across
  field lines) that Goodman's "shuffle" step enforces; the branch envelopes are
  built from smooth running-maximum occupancy integrals so the term is
  differentiable.

* **Extremum alignment** (``extremum_weight``). The per-field-line
  :math:`B_{\min}` and :math:`B_{\max}` minus their field-line averages —
  poloidal closure of the extremal :math:`|B|` contours (Goodman's "align the
  maxima" step; also the flat-:math:`B_{\max}` condition of Dudt *et al.* 2024).

* **Single-well monotonicity** (``squash_weight``). The pointwise distance
  between :math:`|B|` and its monotone branch envelopes — Goodman's "squash"
  distance, which penalizes side wells (more than one magnetic well per period).

Every operation (sigmoid occupancies, running maxima, level-space quadrature) is
smooth or piecewise-smooth, so the residual is jit/grad/jvp-transparent and QI
optimization runs with the exact implicit adjoint, exactly like the QS residual.
These are necessary conditions at finite sampling, not a converse theorem: the
surrogate can be small while the fuller construction remains large.

VMEX keeps the three QI formulations separate:

* :class:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.QIResidual` is the existing compact level-set
  objective; its call signature and defaults are unchanged.
* :class:`~vmex.core.qi.ConstructedQIResidual` applies the fuller smooth
  squash-and-shuffle construction to the same traceable Boozer spectrum.
* :class:`~vmex.core.qi.JInvariantQIResidual` directly minimizes variation of
  :math:`\mathcal J_\parallel` over complete wells. Its pitch array is supplied
  in inverse tesla and is shared across surfaces; it is never renormalized
  independently on each field line.

The action residual excludes cut edge wells but retains complete wells inside
the bounded trace. A pitch block with no complete well on even one sampled field
line, a marginal or merged level, or more wells than ``max_wells`` returns NaN
with a false ``valid_pitch`` flag. This makes a topology error visible instead
of turning it into a favorable zero. The low-level Boozer-spectrum function
accepts cosine and sine harmonics, and so does the equilibrium objective:
:func:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.boozer_bmnc_state` dispatches ``lasym`` states to
the full booz_xform transform and returns ``bmns_b`` alongside ``bmnc_b``,
which every QI residual above passes through. On an up-down-asymmetric deck
the traceable cosine and sine spectra are gated against the host
booz_xform_jax reconstruction at ``2e-2`` and ``3e-2`` relative, and the QI
state derivative is checked against a finite difference of the same objective.

Maximum-J
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A maximum-J field satisfies

.. math::

   \left.\frac{\partial\mathcal J_\parallel}{\partial s}
   \right|_{\alpha,\lambda} < 0, \qquad
   s = \frac{\psi}{\psi_{\rm edge}},

where :math:`s` increases from the magnetic axis to the boundary.
:class:`~vmex.core.maxj.MaximumJResidual` evaluates the action at the same
physical pitch and field-line label on adjacent surfaces, pairs complete wells
only when they are reciprocal nearest neighbours, and forms the physical
finite-difference derivative. The least-squares rows use the dimensionless
slope :math:`\psi_{\rm edge}(\partial J/\partial\psi)/J=(\partial J/\partial s)/J`; ``target=0``
penalizes only violations of the condition above, while a negative target
requests a finite margin.

The result also reports the maximum-J fraction of resolved trapped samples,
the fraction meeting ``target``, deep and shallow subsets split at normalized
trapping depth
:math:`(B_{\max}-1/\lambda)/(B_{\max}-B_{\min})=1/2`, and the fraction of
radial-pitch blocks excluded by topology guards. Fractions are uniform over
the supplied pitch samples by default; ``pitch_weights`` accepts user
quadrature weights. These values are not the bounce-time-weighted Maxwellian
phase-space fraction :math:`f_J` defined by Rodríguez and Plunk. That
diagnostic additionally requires radial and pitch integration weighted by the
normalized bounce time.

VMEX carries the VMEC sign convention through the intermediate derivative:
``psi_edge = signgs*phiedge/(2*pi)`` and the ``APHI`` remap sets the half-mesh
``psi_b`` values. Multiplication by ``psi_edge`` then converts ``dJ/dpsi`` to
the outward derivative ``dJ/ds``; reversing the signed-flux convention cannot
turn a central maximum into a minimum.
A nonmonotone flux map, missing or ambiguous well, topology transition, or
well displacement beyond ``match_tolerance`` returns NaN with
``valid_pitch_pair=False``.

Maximum-J remains a separate objective term. Users combine it with any QI,
aspect-ratio, iota, stability, or engineering residual through VMEX's ordinary
composite least-squares interface; no fixed QI-plus-maximum-J weighting is
built into the class. :class:`~vmex.core.maxj.ConstructedMaximumJResidual`
evaluates the same radial action condition after Goodman's smooth
squash-and-shuffle construction. It is the continuation target analogous to
the published :math:`g_J`: it establishes a favorable direction without
asking a local optimizer to cross actual-well topology changes. The final
:class:`~vmex.core.maxj.MaximumJResidual` remains the physical certificate.

``QI_maxJ_continuation.py`` starts from a minimal vacuum seed, retains a
magnetic-well target, first creates matched QI wells, uses the constructed
field to establish the maximum-J direction, and only then ramps a negative
slope margin in the actual field. It recomputes a common physical pitch once
after the weak stage and freezes it throughout the remaining stages; the
script raises if the incoming wells cannot be resolved at that pitch. The
final stage lengthens the field-line trace and increases the number of
field-line labels, preventing a short trace from aliasing a visibly
non-omnigenous result.
The final ``plot_wout(..., j_pitch=pitch)`` call passes that same pitch to the
polar :math:`J(\alpha,s)` panel, making it a direct visual certificate of the
optimized trapped-particle population.

.. _confinement-qi-fidelity:

Metric fidelity: report the wout-based residual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The traceable :class:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.QIResidual` is built for inexpensive
*gradient flow*, not for *labeling* a configuration. Its level-space envelopes
and finite sampling can report values well below an independent construction.
Use :class:`~vmex.core.qi.ConstructedQIResidual` for production optimization,
with reduced sampling only when its ranking has been checked against the
default resolution. When quoting "how QI is this equilibrium?", also evaluate
the wout/Boozer-based
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.quasi_isodynamic_residual_from_wout` on the written
``wout``. Always report the surfaces and sampling because an outer-surface
total is not numerically interchangeable with a core-to-edge total.


Ideal MHD stability: Mercier and the magnetic well
--------------------------------------------------

Mercier criterion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mercier criterion is the ideal-MHD stability condition for localized
interchange modes resonant on a rational surface — the toroidal generalization
of the Suydam criterion. Following Glasser–Greene–Johnson, the surface is
Mercier-**stable** where

.. math::

   D_{\mathrm{Merc}} = D_{\mathrm{shear}} + D_{\mathrm{well}}
                     + D_{\mathrm{curr}} + D_{\mathrm{geod}} > 0 ,

a decomposition into four flux-surface integrals with distinct physical origin.
:func:`~vmex.core.nyquist.mercier_and_jxb` ports VMEC2000 ``mercier.f`` term
for term (with :math:`{}' \equiv d/d\psi`, :math:`p` the pressure,
:math:`\iota` the transform, :math:`V'` the differential volume, and
:math:`I_\varphi` the enclosed toroidal current):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 20 56

   * - term
     - sign
     - origin
   * - :math:`D_{\mathrm{shear}} = \tfrac14(\iota')^2`
     - :math:`\ge 0`
     - magnetic shear (always stabilizing)
   * - :math:`D_{\mathrm{well}}`
     - either
     - pressure gradient :math:`\times` magnetic well :math:`V''`
   * - :math:`D_{\mathrm{curr}}`
     - either
     - parallel-current / kink drive :math:`\propto \iota'`
   * - :math:`D_{\mathrm{geod}}`
     - :math:`\le 0`
     - geodesic curvature (always destabilizing)

The well term carries the sign of :math:`p'\,(V'' - p'\langle\cdots\rangle)`:
with the pressure decreasing outward (:math:`p'<0`), a magnetic well
(:math:`V''<0`, volume that decreases toward the edge) is stabilizing. The
geodesic term is a manifestly non-positive Schwarz-inequality remainder. Because
the individual pieces involve radial derivatives of surface averages, the two
surfaces nearest the axis and the edge carry the usual numerical noise; a
practical objective penalizes ``min(DMerc[2:-1], 0)``. ``vmex`` exposes the
reporting profile as :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.d_merc`, evaluated through the
parity-proven wout engine.  The live-state counterpart
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.d_merc_state` is a pure-JAX port of the same
``jxbforce.f``/``mercier.f`` path for ``jit``/AD use and agrees with the wout
profile to floating-point round-off.  For optimization,
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.mercier_stability_residual` excludes ``[0:2]``
and the edge and returns
``smoothing * softplus((margin - DMerc) / smoothing)``; targeting it to zero
penalizes unstable (negative) ``DMerc`` with a smooth gradient.  At finite
``smoothing`` the residual is positive, rather than exactly zero, on stable
surfaces but decays exponentially with the stability margin.  Both profile
lanes retain VMEC's near-axis and edge limitations.  The traceable lane
supports ``lasym = True``: the ``jxbforce.f`` mode filter keeps the four
asymmetric geometry families, and on a converged finite-pressure,
up-down-asymmetric tokamak ``d_merc_state`` reproduces the WOUT ``DMerc``
profile to round-off with finite state derivatives.

For a vacuum equilibrium, :math:`p'=0` makes :math:`D_{\rm well}` exactly
zero; VMEX does not add a pressure floor. The reported Mercier index can still
contain shear, current, and geodesic terms. In the additional current-free
limit it reduces to :math:`D_{\rm shear}=S^2/4`, so a positive vacuum value is
a mathematically defined shear result, not a finite-beta interchange margin.

Parallel current and resistive interchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:func:`~vmex.core.stability.jdotb_state` exposes the same full-mesh
``jdotb = <J.B>`` profile that VMEC2000 computes in ``jxbforce.f``, but as a
pure-JAX function of the converged state.  Its WOUT normalization and
extrapolated axis/edge entries are unchanged, so it can be used directly as
an implicit-differentiation current objective. This is a direct port of the
``jxbforce.f`` current reconstruction, distinct from the cheaper
``bootstrap.vmec_j_dot_B`` force-balance identity used by the Redl mismatch.
For optimization, :func:`~vmex.core.stability.jdotb_residual` selects
``jdotb[2:-1]`` to exclude the usual axis/edge entries.
This lane supports ``lasym = True``.  A converged finite-pressure,
up-down-asymmetric tokamak agrees with live VMEC2000 to ``1.52e-3`` relative
over ``[2:-1]``; its regression gate is ``2e-3``.

Assuming the ideal prerequisite :math:`D_{\rm Merc}>0`, the
Glasser--Greene--Johnson necessary condition for local resistive interchange
stability is :math:`D_R \leq 0`.  In the VMEC Mercier normalization, with
:math:`S=d\iota/d\Phi` and
:math:`D_{\rm shear}=S^2/4`, Landreman--Jorge's relation is

.. math::

   D_R = -D_{\rm Merc}
       + \frac{(H-S^2/2)^2}{S^2},\qquad
   H=S\left(t_{JB}-\frac{\langle\mu_0J\cdot B\rangle}
                              {\langle B^2\rangle}t_{BB}\right).

:func:`~vmex.core.stability.glasser_d_r_state` reuses the traceable Mercier
surface integrals and the VMEC-consistent ``jdotb/bdotb`` averages to evaluate
this expression.  Exact zero-shear entries are set to zero because the
criterion is undefined there; a positive ``shear_epsilon`` provides a smooth,
explicit regularization for optimization.  The
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.glasser_stability_residual` helper selects
``D_R[2:-1]`` and smoothly penalizes values above ``-margin``; it defaults to
``shear_epsilon=1e-8`` so zero-shear optimization seeds remain finite.
It must be combined with ``mercier_stability_residual`` so an
ideal-Mercier-unstable surface is never accepted based on :math:`D_R` alone.
After optimization, use ``mercier_shear_state`` to verify
``abs(S) >> shear_epsilon`` on every target surface; regularization makes the
numerics finite but cannot establish GGJ stability at zero shear.
For a pressure-free, current-free equilibrium, :math:`H=0` and
:math:`D_{\rm Merc}=S^2/4`, hence the expression above gives :math:`D_R=0`.
Small reconstructed departures from zero reflect finite-resolution
cancellation; a zero-beta force-free equilibrium with parallel current may
retain nonzero current and geodesic contributions. Vacuum :math:`D_R` is
therefore not a pressure-driven stability margin.
VMEC2000 does not write ``D_R`` itself.  A live `DCON/GPEC
<https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/GPEC>`_ evaluation independently
reproduces the symmetric VMEC normalization at ``ns=51`` (``D_I`` maximum
absolute difference ``9.10e-4`` and ``D_R`` ``8.63e-5`` over normalized
poloidal flux ``[0.1, 1)``).  The same test on an
up-down-asymmetric tokamak exposed unresolved sensitivity in :math:`H`:
at ``ns=201`` the candidate reconstruction's normalized ``D_I`` differs by
at most ``1.85e-2`` over normalized poloidal flux ``[0.2, 0.9]``, but
``D_R`` differs by ``1.49e-2`` and can change sign near marginality. The live
state implementation now retains all four LASYM geometry families and its
boundary JVPs are checked against independently reconverged finite
differences, so it is available for optimization. Publication use near
marginality still requires a nonaxisymmetric JMC/DCON benchmark. The summary
plot omits WOUT-only ``D_R`` for LASYM because that host reconstruction does
not have the live solver state needed to certify the asymmetric normalization.

Magnetic well
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dominant stabilizing ingredient of :math:`D_{\mathrm{well}}` — the sign of
:math:`V''(s)` — is also useful on its own as a cheap, fully traceable proxy.
The ``--plot`` summary shows this dimensional derivative directly, labeled
:math:`V''(s)` (magnetic well), and aligns its zero with the stability-index
axis. Negative values denote a well and positive values a hill.

The separate ``*_stability.png`` figure retains the full Mercier
decomposition and exposes the pressure-gradient dependence more directly.
For a trial pressure derivative :math:`p'`, with geometry and current frozen,
it evaluates

.. math::

   D_{\mathrm{well}}(p') = p'\left(V''-p'T_{pp}\right)T_{bb},\qquad
   D_{\mathrm{Merc}}(p') = D_{\mathrm{Merc},0}-D_{\mathrm{well},0}
     +D_{\mathrm{well}}(p'),

and :math:`D_R(p')=D_{R,0}+D_{\mathrm{well},0}-D_{\mathrm{well}}(p')`.
The plot reports :math:`\min_s D_{\mathrm{Merc}}` and
:math:`-\max_s D_R`, so positive values are favorable for both criteria. It
rescales the WOUT pressure shape to trial volume-average beta; because a
vacuum WOUT contains no such shape, that case is explicitly labeled and uses
:math:`p(s)\propto1-s`. This is a coefficient-level sensitivity diagnostic,
not a finite-pressure stability certificate: geometry, Shafranov shift,
transform, and current respond to pressure, so selected beta points must be
re-solved before drawing a stability conclusion.

:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.magnetic_well` returns the finite-difference
vacuum-well measure

.. math::

   W = \frac{V'(0) - V'(1)}{V'(0)},

with :math:`V'=dV/ds` extrapolated from the half-mesh differential volume
:math:`vp` (VMEC ``bcovar.f``). Positive :math:`W` means :math:`V'` decreases
outward — a magnetic well, favorable for interchange stability — matching
simsopt's ``vacuum_well``. Being a pure
``(equilibrium_state, solver_context)`` function it carries
exact implicit gradients and is a cheaper Mercier-adjacent target. Near-axis
analytic context for both measures is in Landreman–Jorge (2020) and
Kim–Jorge–Dorland (2021); see :doc:`/project/references`.

Ideal ballooning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interchange stability bounds only the :math:`n\to\infty`, radially-localized
limit. The complementary *ballooning* limit — high toroidal mode number,
extended along the field line — is provided by :mod:`vmex.core.stability`
as a fully differentiable eigenvalue objective (a JAX port of the COBRA
solve in the Gaur *et al.* formulation). It solves the self-adjoint
field-line ODE eigenproblem

.. math::

   \frac{d}{d\eta}\!\Bigl(g\,\frac{dX}{d\eta}\Bigr) + c\,X = \lambda\,f\,X,
   \qquad X(\pm\eta_b)=0,

along the straight-field-line angle :math:`\eta`, where :math:`g` is the
line-bending term, :math:`c` the pressure/curvature drive, and :math:`f>0` the
inertia; :math:`\lambda = (\gamma a_N/v_A)^2 > 0` flags instability.
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.ballooning_growth_rate` reduces the batched
eigenvalues to a smooth ``softmax`` scalar built to be driven negative as a
stable-by-construction constraint. The full coefficient definitions are in the
:mod:`~vmex.core.stability` module docstring and the usage recipe in
:doc:`/reference/objectives`.


Bootstrap current (Redl)
------------------------

The self-consistent parallel current a stellarator generates from its own
pressure gradient — the bootstrap current — sets the achievable :math:`\beta`
and, in a QI device, must be kept small. :mod:`vmex.core.bootstrap`
provides a differentiable evaluation and a self-consistency loop (reproducing
Landreman–Buller–Drevlak, arXiv:2205.02914).

Two independent estimates of :math:`\langle\mathbf J\cdot\mathbf B\rangle` are
compared. The **equilibrium** value follows from the exact MHD identity

.. math::

   \langle\mathbf J\cdot\mathbf B\rangle(s) =
   \frac{\langle B^2\rangle\,I'(s) + \mu_0\,I(s)\,p'(s)}{2\pi\,\psi_a},
   \qquad I(s) = \mathrm{signgs}\,\frac{2\pi}{\mu_0}\,\mathrm{buco}(s),

(:func:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.vmec_j_dot_B`). The **kinetic** value is the
Redl *et al.* (2021) analytic closure
(:func:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.j_dot_B_redl`), a fit in the effective trapped
fraction :math:`f_t` and the Sauter collisionalities, with the quasisymmetry
isomorphism :math:`\iota\to\iota-\mathrm{nfp}\,\mathrm{helicity\_n}` applied as
in simsopt. The trapped fraction itself uses the singularity-removing
substitution :math:`y=\sqrt{1-\lambda B_{\max}}` in

.. math::

   f_t = 1 - \tfrac34\langle B^2\rangle
         \int_0^{1/B_{\max}}\!
         \frac{\lambda\,d\lambda}{\langle\sqrt{1-\lambda B}\rangle},

evaluated with fixed-order Gauss–Legendre quadrature so the whole chain stays
differentiable. :func:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.trapped_fraction_from_state`
evaluates the radial profile directly from a converged state; every VMEX WOUT
stores the same full-mesh result as ``vmex_trapped_fraction``. A QI axis with
finite :math:`B_0(\varphi)` mirror ratio therefore has a finite trapped
fraction rather than an imposed zero. Their normalized mismatch is the residual
:class:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.RedlBootstrapMismatch` (the exact formula and
the finite-beta profile conventions are in :doc:`variational-problem`); driving it to
zero, optionally with ``current_dofs`` freed, yields a current profile
consistent with the plasma the equilibrium describes.

Effective ripple
----------------

The Nemov effective ripple is the geometric coefficient that sets the
low-collisionality :math:`1/\nu` transport scale,
:math:`D_{11}\propto\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/2}/\nu`.  NEO conventionally
reports :math:`\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/2}` (``epstot``), not
:math:`\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}` itself.  VMEX keeps the validated NEO
algorithm in the optional NEO_JAX package rather than duplicating a second
neoclassical solver:

.. code-block:: python

   from neo_jax import NeoConfig
   import vmex as vj

   config = NeoConfig(theta_n=64, phi_n=64, npart=40)
   s, epsilon_eff_3_2 = vj.epsilon_effective_from_wout(
       equilibrium.wout, surfaces=[0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.95], config=config)

The in-memory adapter performs BOOZ_XFORM without an intermediate file and
then uses NEO_JAX's batched JAX surface scan.  The smaller configuration used
by ``--plot`` is a trend diagnostic; converged work must refine NEO controls
and verify radial convergence.  The current WOUT entry point is diagnostic,
not an optimization objective.  The planned objective lane will connect the
traceable VMEX state transform directly to NEO_JAX, use its supported
forward-mode sensitivities, and certify them against reconverged finite
differences and STELLOPT NEO before exposing the result in objective tuples.
LASYM is rejected until NEO_JAX carries the asymmetric Boozer harmonics rather
than silently dropping them.
