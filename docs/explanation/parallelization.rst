Why threading, not pmap
=======================

VMEX parallelizes independent equilibrium solves with a plain thread pool,
because each host solve releases the GIL while XLA executes — and the
measured alternatives (pmap over forced host devices, vmap over the callback)
are slower or inapplicable. This page documents what runs in parallel today,
why the mechanism was chosen, its limits, and the multi-GPU design sketch;
the run recipe with the measured scaling table is
:doc:`/howto/parallel-ensembles`. The development box is CPU-only, so no GPU
numbers are fabricated here.

What already parallelizes today
-------------------------------

**Within one solve (XLA threading).**
A single forward solve is a Python loop over jitted 10-iteration blocks
(``mode="cli"``) or one ``lax.while_loop`` (``mode="jit"``). XLA:CPU already
multithreads the batched ``totzsps``/``tomnsps`` transforms and the tridiagonal
preconditioner solves that dominate each ``funct3d`` pass, so a lone solve
already uses several cores. This is automatic and needs no user action.

**Multi-cotangent Jacobian batching (implicit adjoint).**
:func:`vmex.core.implicit.implicit_state_pullback_multi_rhs` uses
``jax.vmap`` over the adjoint right-hand sides, so several state cotangents for
the same fixed point share one implicit linearization and one set of GMRES
operators. For vector forward responses,
:func:`vmex.core.implicit.implicit_state_tangent_multi_rhs` assembles and
factors the nearest-neighbor raw radial operator once, solves all right-hand
sides, and reports each corrected residual. The same factorization supports
the opt-in block-preconditioned transpose pullback; ordinary reverse AD keeps
the established GCROT default.

**Across independent solves (this module).**
An ensemble of independent equilibria — a parameter scan, an ensemble
optimization — is embarrassingly parallel. Each vmex forward solve runs on the
host and **releases the Python GIL while XLA executes** its compiled iteration
lanes, so a plain :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` over the
solves overlaps their execution and gives real wall-clock speedup. This is what
:func:`vmex.core.parallel.solve_ensemble` provides.

The recipe (``solve_ensemble``/``map_ensemble``), the correctness contract,
and how to measure strong scaling on your own host are in
:doc:`/howto/parallel-ensembles`.

Opaque finite-difference derivatives use the same mechanism through
:func:`vmex.core.parallel.finite_difference_jacobian`.  Central probes are
independent, automatically use up to the available workers, and retain input
order.  Advanced users select ``workers=1`` for a serial baseline or an
explicit cap when XLA/BLAS threading would otherwise oversubscribe the host.
For multistart or ensemble optimization,
:func:`vmex.core.parallel.evaluate_problems` accepts one independent problem
object per member so mutable equilibrium caches are never shared.

Workstation defaults and explicit controls
------------------------------------------

``workers=None`` is the beginner default for independent host work.  It
resolves to the smaller of the item count and the CPUs available to the
process, including Linux affinity and common Slurm/PBS/SGE/LSF allocations.
It therefore uses all allocated logical CPUs when enough probes or ensemble
members exist.  ``workers=N`` is the portable override; use ``workers=1``
for a serial reference or a smaller ``N`` when each XLA/BLAS solve is already
large enough that multiple workers contend for memory bandwidth.

A single exact implicit-gradient optimization has no independent equilibrium
probes to distribute.  JAX normally reports one CPU *device* for the entire
host; that device is an XLA CPU backend with its own multithreaded kernels, not
one CPU core.  Consequently, a process monitor showing, for example, 600%
utilization does not mean VMEX has arbitrarily capped a 14-core machine at six
workers.  The remaining work can be sequential, launch-bound, or
memory-bandwidth-bound, and forcing one artificial JAX device per core was
measured slower (see `Mechanisms considered and rejected`_).  VMEX does not
expose a misleading ``workers`` argument on this coupled path.

The controls by workload are therefore:

.. list-table:: Parallel and placement controls
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 25 45

   * - workload
     - ordinary default
     - advanced control
   * - one forward or implicit solve
     - XLA CPU threading / measured automatic placement
     - ``device="cpu"`` or ``device="gpu"`` (or a concrete ``jax.Device``)
   * - finite-difference Jacobian
     - ``workers=None`` (all useful host workers)
     - ``workers=N``
   * - parameter scan / ensemble
     - ``workers=None``
     - ``workers=N`` and one problem object per member
   * - several GPUs
     - no automatic multi-GPU claim today
     - place independent members on explicit devices; single-solve sharding is future work

For a non-default accelerator, pass a concrete device or keep
:func:`vmex.core.device.device_scope` around parameter construction and the
JAX transformation.  JAX's current multi-device model is explicit array and
computation sharding; it does not turn a host callback or an unsharded solve
into a multi-GPU program merely because several devices are present.  See the
upstream `JAX sharding documentation
<https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.sharding.html>`_ for the underlying device
model.  The CPU-only benchmark in this pull request therefore documents the
multi-GPU path as design work rather than presenting invented speedups.

Why the scaling is sub-linear
-----------------------------

XLA already multithreads *within* each
solve, so as the worker count approaches the core count the ensemble workers
and the intra-solve XLA threads draw from the same pool of cores — the falling
efficiency is that contention, not a defect. The absolute speedup therefore
tracks the number of otherwise-idle cores on the box.

Honest limits
-------------

**Load balance (Amdahl).** The ensemble finishes no sooner than its slowest
member. A heterogeneous ensemble of very different-sized decks
(solovev + circular + li383 + nfp2_QA) is dominated by the largest solve and
gains little (~1.1x measured). The sweet spot is a *balanced* ensemble — a
parameter scan at fixed resolution where the members share a compiled
executable and take a similar iteration count.

**The reverse (gradient) pass overlaps far less.** The implicit adjoint
(:func:`vmex.core.implicit.solve_implicit`'s backward pass) is *launch-bound*:
it dispatches many small eager JAX ops whose Python-side dispatch holds the
GIL, so threading a ``value_and_grad`` ensemble overlaps the forward solve well
but the reverse pass barely (~1.05x measured on a 2-member ensemble). Values
and gradients remain bit-identical; the speedup is simply smaller than for a
pure forward-solve ensemble.

Mechanisms considered and rejected
----------------------------------

The threaded ensemble was chosen after comparing three CPU mechanisms on the
same ``nfp2_QA`` scan:

- **Thread pool over independent host solves** (chosen): real overlap,
  bit-identical results, and the only option that handles a *heterogeneous*
  ensemble (different deck shapes) as well as a same-structure scan.
- **pmap across forced host CPU devices**
  (``XLA_FLAGS=--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=N``): **measured 19 s for
  4 solves that cost ~1.5 s each serially — more than 10x slower.** Splitting
  the cores into ``N`` "devices" starves each solve's XLA threading and
  serializes the host callbacks. Rejected by measurement.
- **vmap over the** ``pure_callback``: does not apply to a heterogeneous
  ensemble (different shapes), and for a same-structure ensemble it degenerates
  to a vectorized host *loop* with no true concurrency. Rejected by design.

Multi-GPU (design sketch, future work)
--------------------------------------

The development box is CPU-only, so the following is design, not measurement.

The host solver runs behind :func:`jax.pure_callback`, which cannot execute on
a GPU, so the current ensemble helper is CPU-only. Two complementary GPU paths
are natural extensions:

1. **One equilibrium per device.** Place each ensemble member's traced solve on
   a distinct GPU with ``jax.device_put`` / an explicit ``device=`` argument
   (the solver already threads ``device`` through
   :func:`vmex.core.solver.solve`), and drive the per-device solves from the
   same thread pool. This shards an ensemble across GPUs with no new numerics.

2. **Sharded single large solve.** The fully-traced ``mode="jit"`` lane is a
   pure ``lax.while_loop`` with no host callback, so its per-iteration work (the
   radial × spectral batched transforms) can be sharded across devices with
   ``jax.sharding`` / ``shard_map`` for a single very high-resolution
   equilibrium — the multi-GPU per-*solve* target, distinct from the
   per-*ensemble* target above.

Both are correct-by-construction extensions of existing lanes; neither is
implemented or measured yet. The per-solve GPU *policy* (when a single solve is
faster on GPU vs CPU) is already characterized in :mod:`vmex.core.device`.
