# Run on GPU

Pass `--device gpu` (CLI) or `device="gpu"` (Python) to place a solve on an
accelerator; the default `auto` applies a measured policy that picks the GPU
only where it wins — per-iteration work `ns*mnmax*nznt >= 100_000` and at
most 512 active Fourier modes, where the measured advantage is 2-3x wall
(`benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`).

## Select the device

```console
vmex input.case --device gpu     # explicit: always wins
vmex input.case --device cpu
vmex input.case --device auto    # default: measured policy
vmex input.case --device none    # leave placement to JAX
```

```python
import vmex as vj

result = vj.solve_multigrid(inp, device="gpu")
```

Explicit `device=` always wins. `auto` stands down when you pinned a JAX
default device or platform yourself (`jax.config.update("jax_default_device", ...)`,
`JAX_PLATFORMS`, `jax.default_device(...)`), so VMEX never fights your
placement. Install notes for GPU wheels: {doc}`/installation`.

## When the GPU pays off

The policy in {mod}`vmex.core.device` is measured, not guessed
(`benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`; regenerate with
`benchmarks/device_parity.py` and the benchmark scripts):

- Per-iteration throughput favors the GPU — up to 3x wall on
  NuhrenbergZille-class decks — but the GPU pays fixed per-solve overheads
  (~0.2-0.4 s dispatch/transfer floor plus compile/cache-load on cold
  processes), so small decks that converge in under a second of CPU work
  finish faster on the CPU.
- The work proxy is `ns * mnmax * nznt` (radial surfaces x spectral modes x
  angular grid — the cost driver of the batched `totzsps/tomnsps` matmuls).
  Measured decks split into two clusters: proxies up to ~24e3 where the CPU
  wins (and misclassification costs < 0.5 s either way), and >= ~490e3 where
  the GPU wins 2-3x. `GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK = 100_000` sits between them
  (geometric mean ~109e3). The range between the clusters is not calibrated.
- Mode count is an independent guard: the measured GPU winners have at most
  162 active modes, while a high-resolution HSX deck (`mnmax=858`) ran ~3.4x
  *slower* on the GPU even warm despite a large work proxy.
  `GPU_MAX_SPECTRAL_MODES = 512` sits between the largest measured GPU
  winner (288 modes) and that high-mode CPU winner; the cutoff is not
  claimed as a hardware-independent crossover.

Ask the policy directly:

```python
import vmex as vj
from vmex.core.device import GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK, iteration_work, recommended_device
from vmex.core.solver import resolution_from_input

inp = vj.VmecInput.from_file("input.my_case")
# The finest multigrid stage is the one that dominates the run.
resolution = resolution_from_input(inp, ns=int(inp.ns_array[-1]))

print(iteration_work(resolution), GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK)
print(recommended_device(resolution))    # "cpu" or "gpu"
```

On the two shipped decks that prints `1632 100000` / `cpu` for
`input.circular_tokamak` and `1536000 100000` / `gpu` for
`input.LandremanPaul2021_QA_lowres`.

## What stays on CPU regardless

- **Ensembles.** Multi-solve ensembles are CPU-threaded
  ({doc}`parallel-ensembles`): the host solver's `pure_callback` cannot run
  on a GPU.
- **Implicit Jacobians in optimization.** High-level optimization defaults
  its implicit-gradient path to CPU because it is launch-bound on the tested
  GPUs; low-level {func}`vmex.core.implicit.run` follows JAX placement when
  `device` is omitted, and accepts `device="gpu"` plus
  {func}`~vmex.core.device.device_scope` for explicit accelerator gradients.
- **The dense NESTOR factor.** On a GPU free-boundary run the plasma
  iteration stays on the accelerator while the dense vacuum
  assembly/factor/solve is explicitly placed on CPU
  ({doc}`/explanation/nestor-vacuum`).

## Verify what you got

```console
vmex --doctor
```

prints the JAX backend, visible devices, the active default device, and
VMEX's forward/implicit placement policies. It also executes a small float64
JIT calculation on the selected JAX device; on WSL2 it reports the NVIDIA GPU
and Windows driver visible through `nvidia-smi`. See {doc}`/installation` for
the upstream fixes to the warnings seen with JAX 0.9.2 and the required
JAX/jaxlib upgrade. Per-deck CPU-vs-GPU timings and the decision sweep for a
new machine are in {doc}`/reference/performance`.

## Separate cold compile, cache reload, and warm execution

For a new GPU or a slow installation, run the cache-reload audit from a VMEX
source checkout:

```console
python benchmarks/device_cache_reload.py --devices cpu,gpu \
    --output vmex-device-cache-reload.json
```

The default bounded case records, independently for CPU and GPU:

- a fresh process with an empty compilation cache;
- a second fresh process reloading exactly that cache;
- an in-process warm repeat in each process;
- one implicit MHD-energy gradient;
- actual state/value/gradient placement;
- peak host RSS and device memory.

Each device gets a separate temporary cache, which is removed after the
measurements. `--cache-dir PATH` preserves entries for inspection but accepts
only an empty directory; the benchmark never deletes or mixes with a user's
normal VMEX cache. Use `--full` for the larger parity case and `--devices gpu`
for the shortest WSL2 report. Compare `forward_cache_reload_speedup` and
`gradient_cache_reload_speedup` with the two `reload_*_warm_speedup` values:
the former isolates persistent-cache value across processes, while the latter
shows tracing/cache-load/dispatch overhead still paid above a true warm call.
The committed M4 CPU control is
`benchmarks/device_cache_reload_m4.json`; retain the generated JSON from a
WSL2 GPU run as the hardware-specific comparison artifact.
