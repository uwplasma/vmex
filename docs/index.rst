vmec-jax
========

``vmec-jax`` is a clean-room, JAX-native reimplementation of the **VMEC2000**
ideal-MHD equilibrium code for stellarators and tokamaks. It solves fixed- and
free-boundary equilibria with VMEC2000-parity numerics, writes standard
``wout_*.nc`` output, and — unlike the Fortran original — provides implicit
fixed-boundary derivatives plus scoped free-boundary sensitivities and runs
on CPUs and GPUs. The exact support boundary is tabulated in
:doc:`functionality_matrix`.

Why vmec-jax?
-------------

- **VMEC2000 parity.** The solver ports the VMEC2000 algorithms
  (steepest-descent moment method, 1D radial preconditioner, Richardson time
  stepping, spectral condensation, NESTOR vacuum solve) constant-for-constant.
  Benchmark decks converge in the *same* iteration counts as VMEC2000 and the
  ``wout`` files agree per-variable (see :doc:`performance`). An optional 2D
  block preconditioner cuts iterations 2.5–11x on stiff decks while leaving
  the default path byte-identical.
- **Differentiable.** Gradients of fixed-boundary equilibrium properties
  with respect to boundary shape and profile parameters via implicit
  differentiation of the converged fixed point
  (:mod:`vmec_jax.core.implicit`) — no finite differences, no iteration
  unrolling — validated against central finite differences (see
  :doc:`optimization`), with an O(1)-memory adjoint. Free-boundary
  free-boundary tools provide fixed-surface virtual-casing design gradients
  and forward solved-LCFS sensitivities for a few current groups, both
  finite-difference-validated; a many-parameter NESTOR reverse solve is not a
  production claim (:mod:`vmec_jax.core.freeboundary_diff`). A growing :doc:`objectives
  library <objectives>` — quasisymmetry, omnigenity, Redl bootstrap,
  ballooning stability, gyrokinetic turbulence proxies — plugs straight
  into a least-squares driver with those exact gradients, reaching precise
  QA in a single 14.5-minute CPU call (:doc:`optimization`).
- **Drop-in workflow.** The ``vmec`` command reads VMEC2000 ``input.*``
  namelists and VMEC++-style JSON, prints VMEC2000-format iteration output,
  and writes ``wout_*.nc`` files that load unchanged in simsopt and
  booz_xform.
- **Batteries included.** Built-in plotting (``vmec --plot``), Boozer
  transform (``vmec --booz`` via ``booz_xform_jax``), spline profiles,
  multigrid with hot restart, free boundary from mgrid files *or* directly
  from coils, near-axis (pyQSC/pyQIC) optimization seeding, and typed
  zero-crash error handling. The shared linear/adjoint solver layer is
  factored out into `SOLVAX <https://pypi.org/project/solvax/>`_.

Quickstart
----------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install vmec-jax
   vmec --test                       # bundled QH case: solve + wout + plots
   vmec input.circular_tokamak       # run any VMEC input deck
   vmec --plot wout_circular_tokamak.nc

See :doc:`quickstart` for a full tour, including the Python API and the
Boozer-coordinate workflow.

   Benchmark-suite runtimes: ``vmec_jax`` (cold and warm) versus VMEC2000 and
   VMEC++. Warm (compiled-cache) solves are the relevant number for
   optimization loops; see :doc:`performance` for the full table.
