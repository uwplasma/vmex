Objectives library
==================

Everything you can put in front of the optimizer, in one place.  An
objective in ``vmex`` is an ordinary function (or a small class) of a
*converged* equilibrium — there is no objective base class to subclass, no
registration step.  This page catalogs the built-in objectives by physics
area, shows a minimal usage snippet for each, and ends with the one table
that matters in practice: which objectives support exact implicit gradients
(``jac="implicit"``) and which need finite differences (``jac=None``).  The
first-principles derivations of the metrics themselves — Boozer coordinates,
the quasisymmetry two-term residual, the constructed-QI target, Mercier and
the magnetic well — are on :doc:`/explanation/confinement`.

How objectives plug in
----------------------

:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.least_squares` takes simsopt-style
``(function, target, weight)`` terms.  By default, ``weight`` multiplies the
least-squares *cost*, so each term contributes
``sqrt(weight) * (function(eq) - target)`` rows.  Two calling conventions are
recognized automatically:

- **one positional argument** — the term receives the converged
  :class:`~vmex.core.optimize.Equilibrium` (which carries ``state``,
  ``runtime``, ``wout``, and the input).  Residual-class instances
  (:class:`~vmex.core.optimize.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`,
  :class:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.QIResidual`,
  :class:`~vmex.core.qi.ConstructedQIResidual`,
  :class:`~vmex.core.qi.JInvariantQIResidual`,
  :class:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.RedlBootstrapMismatch`) are callable this
  way, as is any user lambda;
- **two positional arguments** — the term is treated as a pure traceable
  ``(equilibrium_state, solver_context)`` function (the scalar targets below).

For ``jac="implicit"`` every term must be traceable: either a
two-positional ``(equilibrium_state, solver_context)`` callable, or an object
exposing a ``residuals_state(equilibrium_state, solver_context)`` method (the residual classes do — the
optimizer picks it up automatically, so the *same* term list works in both
gradient modes).  Terms that evaluate wout tables on host NumPy
(:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.d_merc`,
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.l_grad_b`, the wout-lane QI residual, the
eigenvector-weighted turbulence proxies) work with ``jac=None`` only —
use :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.mercier_stability_residual` for Mercier and
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.l_grad_b_state` for ``L_grad_B`` with
``jac="implicit"``.

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import vmex as vj
   from vmex import optimize as opt

   inp = vj.VmecInput.from_file("input.minimal_seed_nfp2")
   qs = opt.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual(np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10),
                                       helicity_m=1, helicity_n=0)
   result = opt.least_squares(
       [(qs, 0.0, 1.0),                    # residual class instance
        (opt.aspect_ratio, 6.0, 1.0),      # traceable scalar target
        (opt.mean_iota, 0.42, 1.0)],
       inp, max_mode=5, jac="implicit", use_ess=True)

Quasisymmetry
-------------

:class:`~vmex.core.optimize.QuasisymmetryRatioResidual` is the
Landreman–Paul two-term quasisymmetry ratio residual, sampled pointwise on
the requested flux surfaces (full Gauss–Newton residual geometry, not a
pre-summed scalar).  The helicity pair selects the symmetry family:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - family
     - ``(helicity_m, helicity_n)``
     - contours of ``|B|`` in Boozer coordinates
   * - QA (quasi-axisymmetric)
     - ``(1, 0)``
     - toroidally closed (tokamak-like)
   * - QH (quasi-helical)
     - ``(1, -1)`` or ``(1, 1)``
     - diagonal, pitch set by ``nfp``
   * - QP (quasi-poloidal)
     - ``(0, 1)``
     - poloidally closed, like QI contour topology

``helicity_n`` is in units of ``nfp`` (the simsopt convention). Runnable QA,
QH, and QP scripts are in ``examples/optimization/``.

Scalar geometry and profile targets
-----------------------------------

Here ``equilibrium_state`` contains VMEC's spectral equilibrium coefficients;
``solver_context`` contains the prepared grids, profiles, and transforms. It is
not elapsed run time. All of these are pure two-argument functions — traceable, cheap,
and composable with both gradient modes:

- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.aspect_ratio` — the VMEC/simsopt effective
  aspect ratio;
- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.volume` — plasma volume;
- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.min_abs_iota` — the smallest ``|iota|`` over the
  half-mesh surfaces, and the default transform floor in the shipped
  optimization examples.  A floor on the profile *minimum* is what keeps the
  transform coming from shaping: a mean target is satisfiable while an
  interior surface sits near zero transform, which is exactly what a
  current-carried finite-beta profile does.
  :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.soft_min_abs_iota` is the smooth variant
  (``softmax``-weighted, so it stays within ``[min, max]``) for optimizers
  that stall on the ties of a hard minimum;
- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.mean_iota` /
  :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.edge_iota` — profile-average and boundary
  transform, for decks that genuinely want a target rather than a floor;
- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.mirror_ratio` — ``(Bmax - Bmin)/(Bmax +
  Bmin)`` on one half-mesh surface (outermost by default), the practical QI
  knob;
- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.elongation_profile` /
  :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.max_elongation` — equivalent-ellipse boundary
  elongation from Fourier-exact area and perimeter line integrals over one
  field period;
- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.magnetic_well` — the standard vacuum-well
  measure (positive = well, stabilizing).

For an upper elongation bound, use a zero-target hinge rather than targeting
the threshold itself.  This reproduces the usual SIMSOPT QI constraint while
remaining a pure traceable tuple term:

.. code-block:: python

   import jax.numpy as jnp

   maximum_elongation = 8.0

   def elongation_excess(equilibrium_state, solver_context):
       return jnp.maximum(
           opt.max_elongation(equilibrium_state, solver_context)
           - maximum_elongation, 0.0
       )

   terms = [(elongation_excess, 0.0, 1.0)]

The default Fourier quadrature is resolved for optimization modes through
``max_mode=5``.  ``ntheta`` and ``nphi`` can be passed explicitly to
``elongation_profile`` or ``max_elongation`` for convergence studies.  The
hard maximum and hinge are nonsmooth only at exact ties or at the threshold;
away from those points their implicit derivatives are exact.

The surface convention matters when reproducing another workflow.  Goodman's
original SIMSOPT helper evaluates mirror ratio near the axis, while the VMEX
default uses the outer half-mesh.  Select the former explicitly instead of
retuning an unexplained weight:

.. code-block:: python

   import functools

   near_axis_mirror = functools.partial(opt.mirror_ratio, s_index=1)

VMEX elongation uses constant-toroidal-angle boundary sections and an
equivalent ellipse reconstructed from exact Fourier area/perimeter
integrals.  The legacy SIMSOPT helper intersects planes normal to the magnetic
axis and fits the same area/perimeter ellipse.  They agree closely on modest
shaping but are not identical; report the convention when a result sits on
the elongation threshold.

Two reporting diagnostics run on the host-side wout engine:
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.d_merc` (Mercier interchange criterion) and
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.l_grad_b` (the ``L_grad_B`` coil-complexity proxy).
Their live-state counterparts :func:`~vmex.core.stability.d_merc_state`,
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.jdotb_state`,
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.jdotb_residual`,
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.glasser_d_r_state`, and
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.l_grad_b_state` are pure JAX and can be composed
with implicit differentiation.  ``jdotb_state`` reproduces the VMEC
``jdotb = <J.B>`` WOUT profile; ``jdotb_residual`` selects ``[2:-1]`` for a
least-squares current target.  ``glasser_d_r_state`` evaluates the
Glasser--Greene--Johnson resistive-interchange parameter, for which
``D_R <= 0`` is the necessary stability condition on nonzero-shear surfaces
provided the ideal prerequisite ``DMerc > 0`` also holds.
The convenience
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.mercier_stability_residual` selects
``DMerc[2:-1]`` and returns
``smoothing * softplus((margin - DMerc) / smoothing)``.  Positive ``DMerc``
is stable, so target this residual to zero; the default ``margin=0`` and
``smoothing=1e-6`` give a smooth approximation to the instability hinge
``max(-DMerc, 0)``.  Softplus is strictly positive at finite arguments, so a
stable surface approaches rather than reaches zero; its residual decreases
exponentially as ``DMerc - margin`` grows.

.. code-block:: python

   terms = [(opt.mercier_stability_residual, 0.0, 100.0)]
   result = opt.least_squares(terms, inp, max_mode=3, jac="implicit")

The analogous :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.glasser_stability_residual`
penalizes positive ``D_R[2:-1]``.  Exact zero-shear surfaces are physically
outside the GGJ criterion; the residual uses ``shear_epsilon=1e-8`` by
default so zero-shear seeds have finite optimization rows.  The reporting
profile keeps the strict zero default. Always include
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.mercier_stability_residual` in the same objective
so ``DMerc > 0`` is enforced rather than treating ``D_R`` as a standalone
criterion. Then post-check
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.mercier_shear_state` and require
``abs(S) >> shear_epsilon`` on every target surface; a regularized zero-shear
result is numerically defined but not a valid GGJ stability claim.

``L_grad_B`` additionally has a fully traceable
``(equilibrium_state, solver_context)`` lane,
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.l_grad_b_state` — same convention
(``L_grad_B = |B| sqrt(2 / ||grad B||_F^2)``, same sampling grid and radial
stencils, wout-lane parity to float round-off), rebuilt from the state-field
chain in pure JAX, so it works under ``jac="implicit"``.  The default hard
minimum over the surface grid is exact but has a jumping gradient when the
minimizing gridpoint switches; passing ``softmin_k=k`` selects the smooth
soft minimum ``-logsumexp(-k L)/k`` (a lower bound within
``log(ntheta*nphi)/k``) — optimize with the smooth form, report the hard
minimum (gradient validated against the frozen-path FD to 1.7e-6):

.. code-block:: python

   import functools
   lgradb = functools.partial(opt.l_grad_b_state, softmin_k=50.0)
   result = opt.least_squares(
       [(qs, 0.0, 1.0), (lgradb, 0.35, 1.0)],
       inp, max_mode=3, jac="implicit")

Omnigenity and quasi-isodynamicity
----------------------------------

:class:`~vmex.core.omnigenity.QIResidual` is a smooth, lightweight QI
*surrogate*: bounce-distance uniformity, extremum alignment, and single-well
monotonicity evaluated on a pure-JAX Boozer ``|B|`` spectrum.  It is useful
for inexpensive scouting and exact-gradient tests, but an aggressive
high-mode optimization can reduce it without reducing the full Goodman
squash-and-shuffle distance.

:class:`~vmex.core.qi.ConstructedQIResidual` evaluates that fuller Goodman
construction on the same traceable spectrum.  It is the production QI target.
Use reduced angular and bounce sampling during optimization, then evaluate an
independent resolved grid for reporting:

.. code-block:: python

   from vmex.core.qi import ConstructedQIResidual

   surfaces = np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 6)
   qi = ConstructedQIResidual(
       surfaces, mboz=12, nboz=12, nphi=61, nalpha=18, n_bounce=21
   )
   qi_report = ConstructedQIResidual(
       surfaces, mboz=14, nboz=14, nphi=101, nalpha=29, n_bounce=31
   )
   result = opt.least_squares(
       [(qi, 0.0, 10.0),
        (opt.aspect_ratio, 5.0, 0.005)],
       inp, max_mode=5, jac="implicit", use_ess=True)
   reported_qi = qi_report.total(result.equilibrium)

Sanity anchors (CI-gated): an analytically QI field scores ``< 1e-24``, the
bundled ``nfp1_QI`` deck scores 36x below a circular tokamak and 138x below
the (QA, deliberately non-QI) Landreman–Paul configuration.  The measured
single-call campaign — seed 4.5e-1 to 1.8e-2 (25x) in 17.3 minutes — is in
:doc:`/howto/optimize-a-boundary`.  The earlier Goodman-style *wout-lane* residual
(:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.quasi_isodynamic_residual`, host NumPy,
``jac=None``) remains available for diagnostics and cross-checks.

The sampled value is part of the objective definition: always report the
surface set and discretization with a QI total.  For example, an outer-surface
diagnostic is not numerically interchangeable with a six-surface core-to-edge
objective.  The independent wout/Boozer implementation
(:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.quasi_isodynamic_residual_from_wout`) remains the
cross-check for a finished configuration.

The branch matching, running extrema, and interpolation in the constructed
target are piecewise smooth. Changing ``nalpha``, ``nphi``, or ``n_bounce``
can therefore change the local optimization path even when the value at an
already-QI configuration is converged. For the common ``mboz=12`` optimization
lane, ``(nphi, nalpha, n_bounce)=(61, 18, 21)`` is a useful inexpensive grid;
the example above is the separate certification grid. At least
``nalpha >= 2*mboz + 1`` should be used for a resolved final check. No one
fixed grid guarantees the same basin across NFP and boundary mode number, so
use continuation or a short QP basin stage and verify the final ranking on the
certification grid.

.. note::

   Use ``QIResidual`` only as the explicitly named smooth surrogate.  For a
   production result, optimize ``ConstructedQIResidual`` and cross-check its
   resolved value against the wout/Boozer implementation.  See
   :ref:`confinement-qi-fidelity`.

For a direct action-based target, supply physical pitch values explicitly and
compose the QI and maximum-J terms like any other residuals.  This objective
is a complementary orbit diagnostic, not a drop-in normalization-equivalent
replacement for the Goodman residual:

.. code-block:: python

   from vmex.core.maxj import MaximumJResidual
   from vmex.core.qi import JInvariantQIResidual

   surfaces = np.linspace(0.2, 0.9, 6)
   pitch = np.array([1.0 / 1.1, 1.0 / 1.0])
   qi_action = JInvariantQIResidual(surfaces, pitch)
   maximum_j = MaximumJResidual(surfaces, pitch)
   result = opt.least_squares(
       [(qi_action, 0.0, 1.0), (maximum_j, 0.0, 1.0)],
       inp, max_mode=6, jac="implicit")

The two classes do not impose a shared weight. ``MaximumJResidual`` evaluates
the outward slope ``dJ/ds`` at common pitch using matched wells;
invalid topology is NaN rather than a favorable zero. See
:doc:`/explanation/confinement` for the sign and matching contract.

For continuation from a rough QI seed, use
:class:`~vmex.core.maxj.ConstructedMaximumJResidual` first. It evaluates the
radial action slope in Goodman's differentiable squash-and-shuffle field;
finish with ``MaximumJResidual`` so the optimized, unmodified field supplies
the reported certificate.

When both terms use the same surfaces and pitch,
:class:`~vmex.core.maxj.JInvariantQIAndMaximumJResidual` concatenates their
cost-weighted rows after one shared Boozer transform.

Bootstrap current (Redl)
------------------------

:mod:`vmex.core.bootstrap` implements the Redl (2021) analytic
bootstrap formula, differentiably, plus the machinery to make an
equilibrium's current profile self-consistent with it (plan R26g,
reproducing the workflow of Landreman–Buller–Drevlak, arXiv:2205.02914):

- :class:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.KineticProfiles` — prescribed
  ``n_e/T_e/T_i/Z_eff`` polynomials in ``s`` (objective parameters, not
  VMEC inputs);
- :class:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.RedlBootstrapMismatch` — the paper's
  ``f_boot``: the normalized mismatch between the equilibrium's
  ``<J.B>`` (:func:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.vmec_j_dot_B`, via the MHD
  identity) and the Redl prediction
  (:func:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.j_dot_B_redl`).  Dual-lane: a
  wout-table lane with simsopt ``VmecRedlBootstrapMismatch`` parity, and a
  traceable ``residuals_state`` lane for ``jac="implicit"``.  Evaluated on
  the published optima of arXiv:2205.02914, ``f_boot`` lands at 2.5e-4 (QA,
  2.5% beta), 3.5e-5 (QH 2.5%), 1.3e-4 (QH 5%);
- ``least_squares(..., current_dofs=k)`` — frees the first ``k`` current
  coefficients or ``I'(s)`` spline-knot values plus ``CURTOR`` alongside the
  boundary harmonics, in both gradient modes;
- :func:`~vmex.core.optimize.resample_current_profile` — resamples the
  represented enclosed-current profile onto a chosen number of spline knots,
  so continuation stages can add radial flexibility without changing their
  starting equilibrium;
- :func:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.self_consistent_bootstrap` — a
  fixed-boundary Picard loop that iterates the current profile to
  bootstrap consistency (hot-restarted solves; a tokamak test case
  converges in 9 iterations, ``f_boot`` 0.37 to 3.4e-3).

.. code-block:: python

   from vmex.core.bootstrap import KineticProfiles, RedlBootstrapMismatch

   profiles = KineticProfiles(                      # paper profiles:
       ne_coeffs=4.13e20 * np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]),  # n0 (1 - s^5)
       Te_coeffs=12.0e3 * np.array([1, -1]),               # T0 (1 - s)
       Ti_coeffs=12.0e3 * np.array([1, -1]))
   boot = RedlBootstrapMismatch(profiles, helicity_n=0)    # 0 = QA
   inp = opt.resample_current_profile(inp, 6)
   result = opt.least_squares(
       [(qs, 0.0, 1.0), (boot, 0.0, 1.0), (opt.aspect_ratio, 6.0, 1.0)],
       inp, max_mode=4, jac="implicit",
       current_dofs=5)          # five spline shapes + CURTOR; one knot is fixed

The complete runnable workflows are
``examples/optimization/QA_optimization_bootstrap.py`` and
``QH_optimization_bootstrap.py``.  Their setup has two distinct steps:

1. ``KineticProfiles`` describes the density and temperature seen by the
   Redl model.  Coefficients are in increasing powers of normalized toroidal
   flux ``s``; for example ``[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]`` is ``1-s**5`` and
   ``[1, -1]`` is ``1-s``.  These profiles do not silently replace VMEC's
   pressure profile, so the examples explicitly give VMEC the matching
   ``p = e ne (Te + Ti)`` profile and calibrate its scale to the target beta.
2. ``self_consistent_bootstrap`` alternates a hot-restarted equilibrium solve,
   evaluation of the Redl ``<J.B>`` target, and a power-series refit of
   ``I'(s)``/``CURTOR``.  ``degree`` is the fitted current-polynomial degree,
   ``s_eval`` is the radial collocation grid, ``tol`` bounds the relative
   current-profile mismatch, and ``relax < 1`` damps difficult high-beta
   fixed points.  The returned input and equilibrium seed the differentiable
   optimization; the Picard loop itself is not differentiated.

Before each continuation stage the examples call
``resample_current_profile(inp, n_spline)`` and then use
``current_dofs=n_spline-1``. The new uniform ``I'(s)`` knots preserve ``I(s)``
at the stage boundary; one ordinate stays fixed while the others and
``CURTOR`` become optimization variables. The fixed ordinate removes the
otherwise redundant profile scale. Increasing ``N_CURRENT_SPLINE`` adds radial
current flexibility; it does not change the VMEC boundary ``max_mode``.
ESS scales only boundary
Fourier modes, so current values use a separate parameter scale. In the examples,
``PARAMETER_STEP`` is the characteristic low-order boundary-coefficient step,
``CURRENT_PARAMETER_STEP`` is the characteristic normalized-current step,
and ``MAX_PARAMETER_CHANGE`` is a broad per-stage safety box measured in
those step units.  A safety box should not be active at the solution; exact
hits indicate an artificial optimization floor.  Passing
``restart_from=equilibrium`` when constructing the next
:class:`~vmex.core.problem.VmecProblem` remaps the converged state to its new
resolution and avoids a cold magnetic-axis guess.

The QA/QH examples also include
:func:`~vmex.core.stability.mercier_stability_residual` (stable ``DMerc > 0``)
and :func:`~vmex.core.stability.glasser_stability_residual` (stable ``DR <= 0``
where shear is nonzero). These dimensional VMEC values are much larger than
QS or beta residuals, so their weights must be calibrated explicitly. Their
live-state derivatives are checked against independently reconverged finite
differences in ``tests/test_implicit_grad.py``.

For a vacuum design, :func:`~vmex.core.stability.trial_pressure_d_merc_state`
and :func:`~vmex.core.stability.trial_pressure_glasser_d_r_state` replace the
explicit pressure-gradient term in the Mercier/Glasser expressions by a
chosen trial beta and pressure shape while freezing geometry and current.
Their ``*_stability_residual`` forms are AD-transparent objective rows. This
is a fast pressure-sensitivity proxy, not a finite-beta certificate: it omits
the pressure-driven geometry, current, and Shafranov-shift response, so the
candidate must be re-solved at finite pressure.
``QA_optimization_DMerc_vacuum.py`` exposes the workflow with ``TRIAL_BETA``
and ``USE_TRIAL_STABILITY = True``; ``QH_optimization.py`` carries the same
controls with the lane disabled by default. The stability
rows are introduced only after a QA basin exists, normalized to that stage's
incoming values, and increased in explicit continuation stages. Their
one-dimensional tuple weights are zero for ``s < 0.2``, where the criterion is
singular, and grow smoothly toward the edge, where stability is usually
hardest. The script prints this radial choice whenever it is active. A small
positive ``STABILITY_MARGIN`` avoids accepting a roundoff-level sign change.
The example then adds 0.1% pressure and polishes the *actual* finite-beta
``DMerc`` and ``DR`` on radial grids ending at ``NS=101``.  Only this resolved
finite-pressure equilibrium is reported as the physical stability certificate;
the vacuum and frozen-geometry curves remain useful screening diagnostics.

The QA/QH bootstrap examples write a separate
``*_bootstrap_current.png`` overlay of the equilibrium and Redl
``<J.B>`` profiles. :meth:`~vmex.core.bootstrap.RedlBootstrapMismatch.current_profiles`
returns the same three arrays for custom reporting.

MHD stability
-------------

:mod:`vmex.core.stability` provides the infinite-n ideal-ballooning
objective (plan R26h.h1) — a JAX port of the COBRA eigenproblem in the Gaur
*et al.* (arXiv:2302.07673) formulation, with field-line coefficients per
simsopt's COBRA-validated ``vmec_fieldlines`` conventions and a batched
symmetric-tridiagonal ``eigvalsh`` solve:

- :func:`~vmex.core.stability.ballooning_lambda` — the most-unstable
  eigenvalue per (surface, field line, ballooning parameter); ``λ > 0`` is
  unstable, with ``λ = (γ a_N/v_A)²``;
- :func:`~vmex.core.stability.ballooning_growth_rate` — a smooth
  scalar reduction (``softmax`` upper bound of λ over all lines), built to
  be *driven negative* as a stable-by-construction constraint.

.. code-block:: python

   from vmex.core.stability import ballooning_growth_rate

   terms = [(qs, 0.0, 1.0),
            (ballooning_growth_rate, -0.01, 5.0)]   # keep λ_max below zero
   result = opt.least_squares(terms, inp, max_mode=4, jac="implicit")

Everything inside is JAX AD (geometry derivatives included), so it composes
with both gradient modes; ``d(growth)/d(pres_scale)`` matches finite
differences to 4.7e-9 in CI, and the objective destabilizes monotonically
with pressure on the solovev family, in sign agreement with Mercier.  For
interchange stability, combine with
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.magnetic_well` (traceable) or
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.mercier_stability_residual` (traceable); retain
:func:`~vmex.core.optimize.d_merc` for wout-lane reporting or ``jac=None``.

Turbulence proxies (GKX)
------------------------

:mod:`vmex.core.turbulence` wires the gyrokinetic proxies of
`GKX <https://github.com/uwplasma/GKX>`_ (uwplasma's
JAX-native Hermite–Laguerre flux-tube solver, formerly SPECTRAX-GK;
``pip install gkx``, optional dependency) into the objective protocol
(plan R26h.h4):

- :func:`~vmex.core.turbulence.gk_fieldline_geometry` /
  :func:`~vmex.core.turbulence.flux_tube_geometry` — sample one field
  line of the converged interior solution into GS2/GX-normalized flux-tube
  geometry (``bmag``, ``gds2/gds21/gds22``, curvature/grad-B drifts, …),
  pure JAX, no gkx import needed;
- :func:`~vmex.core.turbulence.turbulent_growth_rate` — the dominant
  linear ITG/TEM growth rate on that flux tube.  Fully differentiable in
  *both* gradient modes (validated 0.44 ``v_th/L`` at the Cyclone-base
  drive ``R/L_Ti = 6.9`` versus ~0 below the critical gradient; AD vs FD
  2.9e-8);
- :func:`~vmex.core.turbulence.quasilinear_flux_proxy` and
  :func:`~vmex.core.turbulence.nonlinear_heat_flux_proxy` — the
  mixing-length and saturation-rule heat-flux surrogates.  These weight the
  dominant *eigenvector*, whose derivatives JAX declines for non-symmetric
  operators — value-level objectives, ``jac=None``.

.. code-block:: python

   from vmex.core.turbulence import turbulent_growth_rate

   terms = [(qs, 0.0, 1.0),
            (turbulent_growth_rate, 0.0, 0.5)]      # push gamma toward 0
   result = opt.least_squares(terms, inp, max_mode=3, jac="implicit")

``jac="implicit"`` requires a fixed-boundary problem. Its boundary parameter
map supports both symmetric and ``LASYM = T`` equilibria. Traceable
quasisymmetry, quasi-isodynamicity, Mercier, Glasser and ``jdotb`` objectives
support both symmetry modes; individual objectives document any narrower
scope. The eight scripts in ``examples/optimization/stellarator_asymmetry``
pair QA/QH/QP/QI with vacuum/finite-beta runs. They copy the immutable input
arrays, set ``LASYM=True``, and add finite ``RBS(1,1)`` and ``ZBC(1,1)`` seed
coefficients so a local optimizer is not trapped in the symmetric subspace.
Twice as many boundary families enlarge the search space but do not by
themselves guarantee a lower minimum; compare equal solve budgets and inspect
the reported asymmetric norm. See
:doc:`/howto/optimize-a-boundary` for the gradient machinery and measured cost of each
piece.

Writing your own objective
--------------------------

Any function of the converged equilibrium is already an objective.  For
finite differences, one argument is enough:

.. code-block:: python

   terms = [(lambda eq: float(eq.wout.b0), 1.0, 1.0)]   # target B0 = 1 T

For implicit gradients, write it as a pure two-positional
``(equilibrium_state, solver_context)`` JAX function — the scalar targets in
:mod:`vmex.core.optimize` (~10 lines each) are the templates to copy.
If it returns a vector, each entry becomes a Gauss–Newton residual row;
give a class a ``residuals_state(equilibrium_state, solver_context)`` method and a
``J(eq)``/``__call__`` pair and it will work in both modes, like the
built-in residual classes.
