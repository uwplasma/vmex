Performance and validation
==========================

This page summarizes the measured performance and parity status of the core
solver. All numbers come from checked-in benchmark artifacts —
``benchmarks/baseline.json`` (CPU suite, regenerated with
``benchmarks/run_baseline.py``) and ``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`` (GPU
matrix, ``benchmarks/run_gpu_matrix.py``; 2x NVIDIA RTX A4000, jax 0.6.2
cuda12) — and from the end-to-end parity suite in
``tests/test_parity_breadth.py``.

High-order strong-force kernel
------------------------------

The independent continuum oracle is fused and cached by radial basis and
validation-grid shape.  ``benchmarks/strong_force.py`` measures pointwise
``J x B - grad(p)`` and its reverse-mode coefficient gradient.  The checked-in
``benchmarks/strong_force_m4.json`` run disabled the persistent compilation
cache, used float64, five Fourier modes, eight radial elements, 64 points, and
20 warm repeats on an Apple M4:

.. list-table::

     - 2.90
     - 0.720
     - 3.43
     - 1.23
     - 6.09e-10

The accuracy column reconstructs ``rho^2 exp(s)`` and compares its second
``rho`` derivative at 2001 points.  Degree 5 reduces that error by about 3700x
relative to degree 3 while retaining sub-millisecond warm force and gradient
evaluation.  Degree 7 is available for p-refinement and certification, but its
clean cold compilation used about 142 MiB more incremental peak RSS than
degree 5.  This measured accuracy/runtime/memory compromise is why degree 5 is
the production default.

High-order low-physics preconditioner
-------------------------------------

``benchmarks/polish_preconditioner.py`` measures the high-to-low transfer,
one stored exact raw-force block factor, and forward/transpose high-order
applications.  The committed ``benchmarks/polish_preconditioner_m4.json``
disabled the persistent compilation cache, used float64 and 20 warm repeats,
and records both accuracy and peak process RSS:

     - 0.0306
     - 0.0336
     - 217

Across these small structural cases, the transfer round trip is below
``1.2e-15``, forward/transpose duality below ``2.6e-15``, and the factored
low-block residual below ``4.8e-12``.  Factor construction includes JAX
assembly/compilation and dominates a first use; its factors are therefore
retained across Krylov steps and continuation stages until the documented
quality policy requests a refresh.  The table is a reproducibility and
overhead gate, not a production-resolution scaling claim.

Collocation-polish derivative gate
----------------------------------

``benchmarks/polish_implicit.py`` measures matrix-free IFT tangents,
adjoints, and the optimization-facing custom VJP of the same rectangular
least-squares stationarity equation used by the public primal.  The clean
Apple M4 record in ``benchmarks/polish_implicit_m4.json`` uses a 17-coordinate
Solov'ev structural gate.  Its primal reaches relative optimality
``1.13e-7`` in nine steps.  Median warm times over ten repeats are 6.44 ms for
the tangent, 6.83 ms for the adjoint, and 6.61 ms for the custom VJP.  With
the persistent compilation cache disabled, cold compile-plus-execute times
are 7.13 s, 7.50 s, and 9.43 s, respectively.

The same record reports incremental process peak RSS of 52.2 MiB for the first
tangent executable, 156.4 MiB for the separately compiled adjoint, and 237.9
MiB for the separately compiled custom-VJP executable.  These increments
include XLA compilation and are intentionally not described as live solve
buffers.  Tangent and adjoint each take 17 Krylov iterations with the
deterministic diagonal normal scaling.  Their complete dot-product mismatch is
``1.90e-10`` and the custom VJP agrees with the explicit adjoint to
``8.75e-21`` relative squared error.  The objective is relative field-strength
variance at ``rho=0.7`` evaluated through the native high-order field view.  Its
implicit directional derivative agrees with two independently re-polished
finite-difference endpoints to ``5.11e-5`` relative error; those two solves take
21.22 s, compared with a 6.61 ms warm scalar gradient.  A Taylor-remainder
test independently verifies the expected second-order decrease under step
halving.  This is a correctness and overhead gate for the production
mathematical formulation at structural resolution, not a production-size
optimization timing claim.

Benchmark suite (CPU, ns = 201)
-------------------------------

Wall times in seconds; "cold" is a fresh process including JIT compilation,
"warm" is a second in-process solve reusing the compiled executable (the
number that matters inside optimization loops, where the structural
executable cache makes every solve after the first warm). Every deck's
final ``NS_ARRAY`` stage is ramped to **ns = 201** — production radial
resolution, where the physics dominates the compile overhead and the warm
comparison is fairest.

``*`` marks an equal-iteration-budget run whose CLI exit was nonzero
(the deliberately NITER-bounded LASYM stress row: both codes exhaust
the same budget, so the wall times compare equal work); ``failed``
marks an aborted run and ``n/a`` an unsupported configuration.

.. end generated-baseline-table

These are wall-clock seconds measured on an otherwise idle Apple-Silicon
host — one fresh process per code, run sequentially (never interleaved), so
each row is one controlled baseline rather than a statistical benchmark;
repeated runs move the small rows by tens of milliseconds and the ratios by
a few percent.  The comparable quantity across hosts is the warm/Fortran
*ratio*, not the absolute numbers.

Reading the table:

- **Warm** solves reuse the compiled executable — the number that matters
  inside optimization loops.  The generated caption above counts the rows
  where the warm solve beats VMEC2000; the converged symmetric
  **free-boundary** row is among them (the NESTOR path reaches VMEC2000
  parity *and* edges out the Fortran wall clock).
- **Cold** runs pay a one-time XLA compile, so a single fire-and-forget run
  is usually slower than Fortran — except on the biggest decks, where even
  the cold run, compile included, wins.  The persistent compilation cache
  removes most of the compile cost on subsequent processes.
- **VMEC++** (10-thread default; invoked once per
  deck through its Python API in a fresh process, same host, same sequential
  protocol) is faster on some converged large decks; its ``failed`` rows
  aborted during the first iterations.  ``vmex`` completes every supported
  convergent row and the deliberately NITER-bounded LASYM stress row
  (zero-crash policy); ``n/a`` marks a configuration the reference does not
  support (``lasym`` free boundary).

Production workflows: CPU vs GPU
--------------------------------

``benchmarks/profile_production.py`` times the five workflows a design
loop actually runs, at production resolution. Warm wall-clock, measured
2026-07-12 (CPU: local Apple-Silicon, idle; GPU: office 2x NVIDIA RTX
A4000, jax cuda12 — different hosts, so read each column on its own terms):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 46 18 18

   * - workflow (warm)
     - M-series CPU
     - A4000 GPU
   * - fixed-boundary solve, ns = 201
     - **5.5 s** (4.3 ms/iter)
     - 6.9 s (5.4 ms/iter)
   * - multigrid ladder 51/101/201
     - **7.8 s**
     - 9.3 s
   * - implicit ``value_and_grad`` (boundary dofs)
     - **17.3 s**
     - 27.8 s
   * - ``least_squares`` opt step (2 nfev)
     - **88.8 s**
     - 151 s

In short: **a fast desktop CPU beats the A4000 GPU on every production
workflow, even at ns = 201.** Forward solves are close. Free-boundary GPU
runs use a hybrid decomposition: plasma iterations stay on the accelerator,
while the small dense NESTOR block runs on CPU with a reused LU factor. The
gradient pipeline is launch-bound on an accelerator,
which is why high-level optimization uses
:func:`vmex.core.device.resolve_implicit_device` to pin implicit-gradient work
to the CPU by default. Low-level :func:`vmex.core.implicit.run` follows JAX
placement when ``device`` is omitted; ``device="auto"`` opts into the
measured CPU policy. The
GPU's wins come against slower server cores and larger-than-production
problem sizes (see the GPU guidance below).

Optimization wall time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whole-campaign numbers, from a near-circular torus to a precise
configuration on a 36-core office CPU (details and scripts in
:doc:`/explanation/adjoint-gradients`): QA to QS 7.2e-6 in **14.5 min** with a single
ESS-scaled ``least_squares`` call (the staged ``max_mode`` 1–5 ladder
reaches 3.7e-7 in 25.5 min), and QI to a 25x omnigenity-residual reduction
in **17.3 min**. Two measured gradient-stack optimizations make that
possible — the block-tridiagonal implicit Jacobian (33x on the Jacobian
phase) and the perturbation warm start (3.7x fewer trial-solve iterations)
— both on by default and documented in :doc:`/explanation/adjoint-gradients`.

Parity with VMEC2000
--------------------

Free-boundary multigrid has a dedicated reproducible artifact,
``benchmarks/freeboundary_multigrid.json``.  On the public converged CTH-like
``NS_ARRAY = 7, 15`` ladder (Apple Silicon CPU, 2026-07-21), VMEC2000 takes
239 + 340 iterations in 0.92 s; vmex takes 250 + 340 iterations, 8.61 s cold
and 1.20 s warm.  Both activate vacuum exactly once.  Against an ns=15
VMEC2000 wout, vmex's final scale-relative maximum errors are
``6.08e-5`` (R), ``3.59e-4`` (Z), ``1.99e-6`` (iota), and ``6.07e-8``
(relative ``wb``).  Both codes enter the fine grid at the same raw residual,
``FSQR = 1.73``, and take exactly 340 fine-grid iterations to the same fixed
point.  Warm execution is within 1.31x of Fortran on this small case; the
one-time XLA compile dominates the cold result.

Per-iteration algorithmic parity (same step control, preconditioner cadence,
constants) means the solver does not just reach the same answer — it takes
the *same number of iterations* as VMEC2000 on the benchmark decks:

     - 123
     - within the ±25% parity gate

Parity holds not just at the converged endpoint but along the whole
trajectory.  The trace below runs the quick-start QH case
(``nfp4_QH_warm_start``, single grid at ``ns=51``) through all three codes
and plots the total force residual ``fsqr + fsqz + fsql`` per iteration:
the vmex curve lies exactly on top of VMEC2000's (both converge in 502
iterations), and VMEC++ follows a
near-identical path (501 iterations).
The vmex trace comes from ``SolveResult.fsq_history``, the VMEC2000
trace from its stdout iteration table run with ``NSTEP = 1``, and the
VMEC++ trace from the ``fsqt`` array of its wout payload.

   (``benchmarks/make_readme_figures.py --only convergence``; traces cached
   in ``benchmarks/convergence_nfp4_ns51.json``).

The parity suite additionally asserts, per case: convergence at the deck's
``ftol``; ``wb`` within 1e-7 relative of the golden wout; boundary/interior
``rmnc/zmns`` harmonics at rtol 1e-5; and ``iotaf`` at rtol 1e-5. Where the
golden VMEC2000 run is itself NITER-capped (LandremanPaul QA, the lasym
tokamak), both codes are stopped at a matched residual and the documented
absolute tolerances cover the golden run's own remaining non-convergence.
wout files are compared per-variable with CompareWOut-style combined
rel+abs tolerances.

Fresh decks against ``xvmec2000`` (2026-09-02)
-----------------------------------------------

The parity table above uses the bundled regression decks.  As a final check
that the 0.8.1 cold-start work did not trade physics for speed, six input
files VMEX had never been benchmarked on — spanning ``nfp = 1`` to ``6``,
tokamak and stellarator, vacuum and finite beta with net current — were run
through ``vmex`` and the reference Fortran ``xvmec2000`` on an Apple M4 (JAX
0.11.1, float64, serial Fortran).  Cold means a fresh process with the
persistent compilation cache removed; warm means a fresh process reusing it;
every run is in a fresh directory so no restart file is picked up.  The
machine-readable record with provenance (vmex commit, reference binary hash,
deck hashes, per-deck maxima) is
``benchmarks/fresh_decks_vs_vmec2000_2026-09-02.json``; the per-deck
narrative is the companion ``.md``.

On every deck VMEX reproduces the Fortran trajectory — the same per-level
iteration counts (the ITER model differs by one iteration at its 1e-18
round-off floor), the same Jacobian-reset counts, the same final residuals to
three figures — and the exported ``wout`` quantities (volume, aspect ratio,
beta, ``b0``, ``iotaf``, ``presf``, ``phi``, boundary harmonics) agree to at
most ``1.4e-10`` relative in ``iotaf`` (ARIES-CS, the finite-beta net-current
case), ``2.2e-13`` in beta, and ``1e-17`` absolute in the boundary harmonics;
the per-deck maxima are in the artifact.  Warm, VMEX ranges from parity to twice the speed of the
Fortran and is fastest exactly where runtime matters most (HSX, ESTELL).  The
cold gap is XLA compilation and nothing else: on the worst case (the ITER
model) the compile census counts 12.65 s across 650 programs — one
``_block_lane`` compile per ``NS_ARRAY`` level plus a tail of single-op
programs — matching the 12.0 s cold-minus-warm difference; it is paid once per
machine and JAX version.

Numerical reproducibility
-------------------------

Everything runs in float64 (``jax_enable_x64`` is mandatory).  Two solves of
the same input on the same machine, JAX version, and device are bit-identical.
Across VMEX versions the *algorithm* is fixed but the compiled graph is not:
restructuring a traced lane changes XLA's fusion and hence the association
order of floating-point reductions, so trajectories can differ from an earlier
release at one unit in the last place per iteration.  On the regression decks
this compounds to ``~1e-10`` relative in the late-iteration residual history
with identical iteration counts and converged geometry agreeing to ``1e-12``;
the golden, restart, step-control, and parity suites pin exactly that
tolerance class.  CPU and accelerator results agree to the same class (the
batched tridiagonal solver on accelerators is numerically equivalent, not
bit-identical, to the CPU Thomas sweep).  Persistent compilation-cache hits
reload byte-identical executables, so cached and freshly compiled runs agree
bit for bit.

2D block preconditioner
-----------------------

The default 1D radial preconditioner is what reproduces VMEC2000
iteration-for-iteration. For *stiff* decks — very high aspect ratio or strong
finite-β coupling — an opt-in 2D block preconditioner
(:mod:`vmex.core.preconditioner_2d`) replaces the radial-only approximation
with a matrix-free Newton step: a Jacobian-vector-product Hessian applied
through GMRES (SOLVAX's ``block_thomas_truncated`` / Krylov layer). It cuts the
iteration count 2.5–11x on the stiff cases below, and is a strict add-on — the
default 1D path stays byte-identical, so parity is untouched.

   :width: 90%

   Iterations to converge, 2D block vs 1D radial preconditioner
   (``benchmarks/make_readme_figures.py --only precond``).

It is opt-in, not the default, on purpose. Fewer iterations is not fewer
seconds: each 2D Newton step (a GMRES solve over Hessian-vector products) costs
far more than a 1D radial sweep, so the measured wall-clock ranges 0.55–1.16x
across easy and stiff decks — a wash to *slower* (≈2x slower on a plain circular
tokamak, a tie even on the aspect-100 case) — and peak memory is ≈30% higher
(the extra GMRES/HVP compile graph). The converged ``wb`` matches the 1D result
to ~1e-10, so it changes the path, not the fixed point. Reach for it when the
1D iteration count is the bottleneck or stalls, not as a blanket default.

One such stall is reproducible on the aspect-100 case at ``ns=51`` and
``FTOL=1e-11``.  With ``PRECON_TYPE='GMRES'`` and
``PREC2D_THRESHOLD=1e-6``, VMEX converges in 18 iterations, while VMEC2000's
finite-difference block GMRES remains at a maximum residual of ``2.05e-9``
after 1,600 explicit ``PRE_NITER`` steps.  A separate VMEC2000 1-D solve
converges and agrees with the VMEX result in ``wb`` to ``1.3e-11`` relative
and in the primary geometry to better than ``1e-5``.  The opt-in live test
``test_live_vmec2000_exact_jvp_gmres_robustness`` reproduces all three paths.
This is a convergence-reliability result, not a CPU speed or memory claim:
the small VMEC2000 1-D solve is still much cheaper than a cold JAX process.

Memory
------

Peak resident memory is 0.6–1.5 GB on most bundled rows and about 3.3 GB on
the largest bundled multigrid deck, but those figures are not a
high-resolution upper bound. The spectral state is small; compiled transform
graphs and implicit block factors are not. On high-mode decks the separable
toroidal FFT synthesis reduces peak memory relative to the full mode-stacked
contraction -- 8.21 GB against 9.63 GB on the 537-mode CTH-like case in
``benchmarks/high_mode_fft.json`` -- while wall time is not improved there
(983 s against 826 s cold, and a tie warm at 335 s); both runs in that record
stop at the iteration cap, so they are compared on cost, not on a converged
answer.  The stage-cache release keeps peak RSS at the largest single rung. A residual memory gap to
single-purpose compiled implementations remains, dominated by XLA compiled
executables and the runtime floor rather than by the physics working set.
Current-head numbers for the reference high-mode deck are produced by the
reproducible harness (``benchmarks/profile_high_resolution.py`` and
``benchmarks/run_baseline.py``) rather than recorded here, so the
documentation cannot go stale against the code.

The new synthesis repacks the signed helical coefficients into separable
theta/zeta blocks, evaluates zeta with ``jax.numpy.fft.irfft``, and
performs a short real poloidal contraction. Undersampled toroidal grids fall
back to the established dense DFT. The implicit callback also retains the
dense-real path: a direct FFT tangent expanded complex Jacobian probe batches
past 10 GiB RSS, and compiling fast primal plus dense tangent representations
in one process exceeded 7 GiB. Fixed-boundary
:func:`~vmex.core.solver.solve` and
:func:`~vmex.core.multigrid.solve_multigrid` select separate FFT lanes only
above 512 modes on accelerators and ARM CPUs. Smaller problems retain the
dense-real lane: on the M4, FFT was 38--88% slower warm on three 5--8-mode
routine decks and its 8% warm win at 128 modes came with a 13% first-solve
loss. At 162 modes, both lanes reached the supplied 10,000-iteration cap with
near-zero residuals, but dense was 4.3% faster (279.55 s versus 291.69 s).
x86 CPUs also remain dense: on the x86 hosts measured so far the dense
contraction beat the FFT repacking, while ARM CPUs and accelerators prefer
the FFT path above the mode threshold.  Re-run
``benchmarks/profile_high_resolution.py`` on the target host to re-derive the
choice rather than trusting stale numbers.
Explicit ``use_fft=True`` or ``use_fft=False`` always wins. Implicit AD
retains the dense lanes and their existing checksum/storage gate. The shared
runtime pytree is unchanged.

Stage-cache release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The one-shot CLI calls JAX's public ``clear_caches`` between distinct radial
grids, so peak memory tracks the largest single rung instead of accumulating
every rung's executables; the persistent on-disk compilation cache is
unaffected.  Library :func:`~vmex.core.multigrid.solve_multigrid` and
:func:`~vmex.core.multigrid.solve_free_boundary_multigrid` retain warm stage
executables by default (the right policy for scans and repeated solves) and
accept ``release_stage_cache=True`` to opt into the one-shot behaviour.
The machine-scoped disk cache is bounded to 10% of the free disk (2 GiB
floor, 20 GiB ceiling).  On macOS with jaxlib < 0.10 the cache defaults to
off: those jaxlib releases crash with ``SIGBUS``/``SIGILL`` inside
``PyClient::DeserializeExecutable`` when loading a cached CPU executable
holding more than a few hundred kernels (LLVM ORC materializes the
per-kernel objects recursively on one fixed-size worker-thread stack), and
every solve-scale executable exceeds that.  Upgrading jaxlib re-enables the
cache automatically; ``VMEX_COMPILATION_CACHE=1`` forces it on for small
workloads.  VMEX does not delete caches owned by other applications.
The CLI and library compile solver lanes sequentially by default.
``--prefetch-compile`` (or ``prefetch_compile=True`` in the library) overlaps
the next rung's compilation.  This can reduce cold-start latency on a
core-rich host, but increases peak memory and can contend with the active
solve when the available CPU set is small.  ``--no-prefetch-compile`` remains
an explicit spelling of the default.

Reproducible resource profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``benchmarks/profile_resources.py`` is the common fixed-boundary,
free-boundary, implicit-AD, and mirror resource harness. Each case runs in a
fresh process and reports cold and warm wall time, OS peak RSS, device peak
memory when the backend exposes it, residuals, iterations, native thread
count, and output or gradient SHA-256. Prefetched fixed- and free-boundary
rows also report XLA executable memory. Other rows state why no executable
estimate is available.

The harness selects hardware only through the public ``device=`` API. It
records inherited JAX platform environment settings instead of creating
them. ``--device gpu --device-index 1`` selects a second visible GPU by
passing its JAX device object, without a platform environment pin. Fetch the
released mgrid assets before the default free-boundary row::

   python tools/fetch_assets.py --bundle reference-nc
   python benchmarks/profile_resources.py --device cpu --out /tmp/vmex-resources.json

An external high-resolution deck can replace the fixed and implicit inputs
without copying it into the repository::

   python benchmarks/profile_resources.py \
     --cases fixed,implicit \
     --fixed-input /path/to/input.hsx \
     --implicit-input /path/to/input.hsx \
     --vmec2000-executable /path/to/xvmec2000 \
     --vmec2000-source /path/to/STELLOPT \
     --vmecpp-python /path/to/vmecpp-python \
     --vmecpp-source /path/to/vmecpp \
     --vmecpp-threads 10 \
     --out /tmp/hsx-resources.json

The default retains compiled stages for a repeated library solve.
``--release-stage-cache --no-prefetch-compile`` instead measures the
lower-peak, one-shot policy used by the CLI. Its second timing can reload
released stages and is therefore not an in-memory warm-run measurement.

The report stores input and executable hashes, VMEX/JAX versions, VMEC++
version, hardware, and git revision without storing private paths. Mirror
scaling defaults to the ``5:7:4,7:13:7,9:17:9`` coarse/medium/fine ladder;
``--mirror-ladder`` changes it explicitly.

Implicit-storage experiments (recorded so they are not repeated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Column chunking bounds simultaneous design-variable probes, not the dominant
dense ``O(ns * m_block**2)`` block bands and factors.  Candidate reductions
were measured on a fixed high-mode implicit workload with
``benchmarks/profile_high_resolution.py`` (which records resolution, devices,
wall time, peak RSS, and the Jacobian's finiteness, norm, and SHA-256) and
rejected, each for a concrete reason:

- an automatic chunk schedule was faster but raised peak RSS by more than a
  third;
- float32 bands/factors and row scaling made the demanding Jacobian
  non-finite -- low precision is not a safe drop-in replacement;
- a regularised scaled factorisation more than doubled the wall time;
- matrix-free GMRES sampled ~24% less memory but did not finish one Jacobian
  in over five times the block-path wall;
- streaming the three radial probe colours preserved the checksum but the
  allocator retained loop intermediates into factorisation, *raising* RSS;
- differentiating a genuinely local three-surface kernel (which matches the
  global residual to ``2e-12``, LASYM included) still failed the end-to-end
  gate: compilation/allocator retention plus the unchanged dense factors
  erased the local-temporary saving.  The kernel remains as a tested
  foundation for a future lower-storage factor representation.

The conclusion stands until the factor *representation* changes: scalar
objectives use the matrix-free reverse adjoint, vector objectives keep the
exact block path, and any new storage candidate must reproduce the recorded
norm/checksum and beat both wall and RSS end to end.

GPU guidance
------------

Measured behavior (``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`` plus the supplied
high-mode HSX case):

- **Per-iteration throughput favours the GPU across the tested low- and
  moderate-mode cases** (0.83 ms vs 1.90 ms per iteration at
  ``ns=35, mpol=2, ntor=2``; up to ~3x on NuhrenbergZille-class decks:
  90 s vs 277 s wall).
- **The GPU pays fixed per-solve overheads** (~0.2-0.4 s dispatch/transfer
  floor plus compile or cache-load in cold processes), so small decks that
  finish in well under a second of CPU work stay faster on the CPU
  (``solovev``: 0.043 s CPU vs 0.29 s CUDA warm).
- **Fast desktop CPUs change the calculus**: the GPU wins above were
  measured against the office box's slower server cores. Against an idle
  Apple-Silicon CPU, the CPU wins every production workflow even at
  ``ns = 201`` (the table above) — on a modern desktop, treat the GPU as
  an option for very large or heavily batched solves, not a default.
- **High Fourier mode count is a separate limit**: on the same office host,
  the 858-mode HSX deck was 3.44x faster on CPU than on a cache-warm A4000,
  despite its large aggregate work proxy.

Device policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:mod:`vmex.core.device` encodes this as a default placement rule using
the per-iteration work proxy ``ns * mnmax * nznt`` (the cost driver of the
batched-matmul transforms): the solve stays on CPU below
``GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK = 100_000`` and above
``GPU_MAX_SPECTRAL_MODES = 512``, and uses GPU in the middle region.  The
calibration evidence and the full precedence rules — an explicit ``device=``
argument always wins, ``device=None`` leaves placement to JAX, and an active
``jax.default_device`` context or user-pinned platform makes ``"auto"``
stand down — are in :ref:`explanation/architecture:Device policy (CPU/GPU)`.

.. code-block:: python

   solve(inp, device="cpu")
   solve(inp, device="gpu")
   with jax.default_device(jax.devices("gpu")[0]):
       solve(inp)  # AUTO respects this context

The mirror solver uses its own measured default because host SciPy repeatedly
drives JAX callbacks: ``vmex.mirror`` solves choose CPU under ``"auto"``
with the same explicit/``None``/active-context precedence (measurement in
:ref:`explanation/architecture:Device policy (CPU/GPU)`).

Persistent compilation cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``vmex`` enables JAX's persistent XLA compilation cache on CPUs and
accelerators, so the multi-second compile cost is paid once per machine, not
once per process.

On macOS CPU, VMEX also raises XLA's parallel-codegen partition count from 32
to 128. This bounds LLVM linker recursion for large differentiated
single-stage graphs and avoids native stack-guard failures without changing
floating-point operations. An explicit user ``XLA_FLAGS`` value always wins;
accelerator backends receive no CPU-only flag.

.. warning::

   **cwd-shadowing pitfall.** Running ``python`` with a working directory
   that contains a ``vmex`` source checkout can shadow the installed
   package as a namespace package: ``vmex/__init__.py`` never runs, the
   persistent compilation cache is never enabled, and every solve pays the
   full XLA recompile (measured ~7 s vs ~1.7 s warm on CUDA for solovev).
   If GPU runs are mysteriously slow, check that
   ``python -c "import vmex; print(vmex.__file__)"`` points where
   you expect.

Float64 is required (enforced at solver import). On GPUs this means fp64
arithmetic, but the solve is latency- rather than FLOP-bound at benchmark
sizes: the tridiagonal preconditioner solve, for instance, measures identical
fp32/fp64 GPU times (~15 us per radial row, independent of the number of
spectral columns).

GPU decision sweep (office rig)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One command produces every CPU-vs-GPU crossover curve on a dual-GPU host —
warm per-iteration marginals on the ``ns x mnmax`` grid (``ns`` 51/101/201,
``mnmax`` 8/128/288) for the production CLI lane and the multigrid ladder,
the free-boundary NS sweep (steady vacuum lane, NESTOR included), the
537-mode probe where the GPU default switches to FFT synthesis, and the
fixed/free/gradient workflow profiles (cold+warm+memory)::

   python benchmarks/run_gpu_matrix.py --office --out benchmarks/gpu_office.json

Each cell is a fresh subprocess selecting hardware through the public
``device=`` API.  For the CUDA-graph A/B, repeat with command buffers and a
second output file, then compare the two ``stepscan`` sections::

   python benchmarks/run_gpu_matrix.py --office \
       --xla-flags "--xla_gpu_enable_command_buffer=FUSION,CUSTOM_CALL" \
       --out benchmarks/gpu_office_cmdbuf.json

The applied ``XLA_FLAGS`` are recorded in the artifact's ``meta`` block.

Reproducing the numbers
-----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   python benchmarks/run_baseline.py         # CPU suite -> benchmarks/baseline.json
   python benchmarks/run_freeboundary_multigrid.py  # free-bdy ladder + VMEC2000 parity
   python benchmarks/run_gpu_matrix.py       # GPU matrix -> benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json
   python benchmarks/profile_production.py --device cpu
   python benchmarks/profile_production.py --device gpu
   pytest tests/test_parity_breadth.py     # end-to-end parity suite

For a compact hardware-parity audit, ``device_parity.py`` runs the same small
nonzero-shear equilibrium on explicitly selected CPU/GPU devices and records
the forward state plus boundary derivatives of MHD energy, magnetic well, quasisymmetry,
quasi-isodynamicity, and the mean traceable ``DMerc``, ``jdotb``, and
Glasser ``D_R`` interior profiles in JSON. It does not set or require JAX
platform environment variables::

   python benchmarks/device_parity.py --quick --metrics mhd_energy --output /tmp/vmex-smoke.json
   python benchmarks/device_parity.py --devices cpu,gpu --output /tmp/vmex-parity.json

On a CPU-only host the default runs the CPU lane and marks the cross-device
comparison as skipped; ``--devices cpu`` requests that lane explicitly.
The first command is the short smoke lane; omit ``--metrics`` to audit all
seven objectives.

The parity suite needs the golden VMEC2000 fixtures (fetched release assets);
it is skipped automatically when they are unavailable.

Workflow observability harness
------------------------------

``benchmarks/profile_workflows.py`` is the one driver for timing, memory,
and compile observability of the principal workflows. Every record separates
build, per-stage execution (fenced with ``block_until_ready``), and — for the two
process-level regimes — total process wall time, alongside trace/compile
counts read from JAX's own ``jax_log_compiles`` records and peak host RSS::

   python benchmarks/profile_workflows.py --list
   python benchmarks/profile_workflows.py F1 F4 --regimes cold warm
   python benchmarks/profile_workflows.py --all --regimes warm --out benchmarks/baselines/m4/
   python benchmarks/profile_workflows.py F4 C2 --trace-dir benchmarks/traces/

The registry covers the workflow matrix defined in
``benchmarks/profile_workflows.py``: fixed-boundary solves (single-grid,
multigrid, polished), implicit value/gradient, vector residual
plus full Jacobian, hot-restart scans, optimization campaigns (scalar
L-BFGS-B and residual least-squares), single-stage plasma-plus-coils with
ESSOS, the free-boundary implicit value and adjoint, symmetric-versus-LASYM
pairs at matched resolution, mirror equilibria (fixed-boundary,
free-boundary, and the periodic hybrid with its GK geometry export), Boozer
transforms at one and many surfaces, and the epsilon-effective and Gamma-c
diagnostics. ``--trace-dir`` captures one XProf trace per stage on a warm
repeat, so every workflow class has execution-level evidence, not only wall
times. Committed baselines live under ``benchmarks/baselines/`` (one
directory per platform), each record stamped with the commit it measured
and a clean-tree flag.

Five timing regimes are never mixed in one number:

``cold``
   a fresh process with an emptied persistent compilation cache;
``cache_reload``
   a second fresh process reusing the cache the matching ``cold`` run
   populated (the record carries the entry counts before and after, so a
   reload claim always has logged evidence);
``warm``
   same process, same shapes and static arguments — the median of repeats;
``warm_newparams``
   same process, changed physical parameters at unchanged shapes (the
   no-recompile contract, asserted by the harness's own tests);
``reshape``
   same process, changed resolution.

Two measurement traps the harness handles, documented because they silently
zero results otherwise: importing vmex sets ``jax_logging_level = "ERROR"``,
which filters the records the compile counter reads (the harness imports vmex
before installing its handler), and ``jax_explain_cache_misses`` breaks
``jax.lax.platform_dependent`` on jax 0.9.2 inside the very solves being
measured, so it is opt-in rather than default.
