Architecture
============

The production implementation lives in :mod:`vmex.core`: one concern per
module, each with a header docstring naming its VMEC2000 counterpart file(s)
and the equations it implements. Everything is pure-JAX and shared between
the CLI, the differentiable API, plotting, and the wout writer — there is a
single set of physics kernels.

State and purity
----------------

The solver state is a frozen pytree
(:class:`~vmex.core.solver.SpectralState`): spectral coefficients of
:math:`R, Z, \lambda` (plus the asymmetric partners when ``lasym``), the
Richardson velocity, time step, damping history, iteration counters, and the
restart flag. All solver functions are pure ``state -> state`` maps, which is
what makes the same kernels usable from ``jit``, ``grad``, and ``vmap``.

Static configuration (resolutions, flags) is hashable and kept out of traced
signatures; mode and radial arrays are padded to the maximum multigrid
resolution so all ``NS_ARRAY`` stages share one compiled executable.

Two lanes, one physics
----------------------

- ``solver.solve(...)`` — a ``lax.while_loop`` over the jitted iteration,
  fully traceable: the forward solver of the differentiable API.
- the CLI lane — a Python ``while`` around the same jitted N-iteration block
  kernel, with host-side residual checks between blocks: exact-``ftol`` early
  exit, live VMEC2000-format printing, buffer donation, no AD bookkeeping.

Both lanes call identical physics kernels; a regression test asserts
per-block state agreement to machine precision.

Device policy (CPU/GPU)
-----------------------

:mod:`vmex.core.device` implements a *measured* CPU/GPU placement policy
for the solve lanes (calibrated against ``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json``).
The cost driver of one iteration is the ``totzsps/tomnsps`` batched-matmul
work, proxied by

.. math::

   w = \mathrm{ns} \times \mathrm{mnmax} \times \mathrm{nznt}

(:func:`~vmex.core.device.iteration_work`). Per-iteration throughput
favours the GPU across the tested low- and moderate-mode cases, but the GPU
pays fixed per-solve overheads (dispatch/transfer floor plus compile or cache
load), so small decks finish faster on the CPU.  High-mode transforms are a
second measured exception: an 858-mode HSX deck was 3.44x faster on CPU than
on a cache-warm RTX A4000 on the same host.  Therefore
:func:`~vmex.core.device.recommended_device` returns ``"cpu"`` below
:data:`~vmex.core.device.GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK` (``100_000``), ``"cpu"``
above :data:`~vmex.core.device.GPU_MAX_SPECTRAL_MODES` (``512``), and
``"gpu"`` in the middle region, per multigrid stage.  The measured GPU
winners have at most 162 modes and the measured CPU winner has 858; the
intermediate range is not calibrated.  The round 512 cutoff preserves prior
AUTO behavior for common stages through 288 modes while catching that
high-mode regression; it is not a universal crossover.

:func:`~vmex.core.device.resolve_device` turns this into a concrete
placement with strict precedence rules: an explicit device always wins;
``device=None`` follows JAX placement; and the default ``device="auto"``
policy stands down for an active ``jax.default_device`` context or a
user-pinned JAX platform.  The recommendation is applied only when its
platform is available. :func:`~vmex.core.device.device_context` wraps a stage
in the corresponding ``jax.default_device``.

The optimization path is different:
:func:`~vmex.core.device.resolve_implicit_device` **pins the
implicit-gradient work to the CPU by default when VMEX owns placement**. The
``jac="implicit"`` Jacobian builds a per-dof vmapped
forward-implicit-differentiation graph —
dozens of preconditioned GMRES solves with inner control flow — whose XLA
compile time grows with the dof count and whose execution is
kernel-launch-bound; measured on GPU it is slower than the CPU at every
optimization size tested. The forward equilibrium callback uses the solver's
independent automatic per-stage placement policy; the implicit-device choice
controls the residual and Jacobian graphs. Explicit ``device=`` arguments and
JAX placement contexts are still honored for those graphs.

Mirror equilibria have a third measured policy:
:func:`~vmex.core.device.resolve_mirror_device` selects CPU by default for
their SciPy-controlled JAX callback loop (35.2 s CPU versus 44.2 s RTX A4000
on the office ``15x15`` case). Fixed/free-boundary mirror solves and beta
scans still honor explicit devices, ``device=None``, and active JAX placement
without environment variables.

Naming conventions
------------------

Community-expected VMEC names are kept (``ns, mpol, ntor, nfp, lasym, iotaf,
presf, rmnc, zmns, lmns, bmnc, ...``). Internal Fortran temporaries get
descriptive names (``sqrt_g`` rather than ``gsqrt``); every module docstring
cross-references the VMEC2000 source it ports.
