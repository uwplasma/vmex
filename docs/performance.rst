Performance and validation
==========================

This page summarizes the measured performance and parity status of the core
solver. All numbers come from checked-in benchmark artifacts —
``benchmarks/baseline.json`` (CPU suite, regenerated with
``benchmarks/run_baseline.py``) and ``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`` (GPU
matrix, ``benchmarks/run_gpu_matrix.py``; 2x NVIDIA RTX A4000, jax 0.6.2
cuda12) — and from the end-to-end parity suite in
``tests/test_parity_breadth.py``.

Benchmark suite (CPU, ns = 201)
-------------------------------

Wall times in seconds; "cold" is a fresh process including JIT compilation,
"warm" is a second in-process solve reusing the compiled executable (the
number that matters inside optimization loops, where the structural
executable cache makes every solve after the first warm). Every deck's
final ``NS_ARRAY`` stage is ramped to **ns = 201** — production radial
resolution, where the physics dominates the compile overhead and the warm
comparison is fairest.

Bold marks vmex beating VMEC2000. These are wall-clock seconds on a
shared Apple-Silicon CPU (``benchmarks/baseline.json``), so the
warm/Fortran *ratio* is the comparable quantity, not the absolute numbers.

Reading the table:

- **Warm** solves beat VMEC2000 on 12 of the 14 rows — typically 1.2–2.3x —
  and tie on the other two (DSHAPE, the reactor-scale QH). This includes
  both **free-boundary** rows: the NESTOR path converges to VMEC2000 parity
  *and* now edges out the Fortran wall clock.
- **Cold** runs pay a one-time 7–30 s XLA compile, so a single
  fire-and-forget run is slower than Fortran — except on the biggest deck
  (NuhrenbergZille at ns=201), where even the cold run, compile included,
  beats VMEC2000. The persistent compilation cache removes most of the
  compile cost on subsequent processes.
- **VMEC++** is faster on some converged large decks (free
  boundary, LandremanPaul QA) but *failed* rows aborted during the first
  iterations; ``vmex`` converges on the full suite (zero-crash policy).
  ``n/a`` marks a configuration VMEC++ does not support (``lasym`` free
  boundary).

Production workflows: CPU vs GPU
--------------------------------

``benchmarks/profile_production.py`` times the five workflows a design
loop actually runs, at production resolution. Warm wall-clock, measured
2026-07-12 (CPU: local Apple-Silicon, idle; GPU: office 2x NVIDIA RTX
A4000, jax cuda12 — different hosts, so read each column on its own terms):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 46 18 18

   * - workflow (warm)
     - M-series CPU
     - A4000 GPU
   * - fixed-boundary solve, ns = 201
     - **5.5 s** (4.3 ms/iter)
     - 6.9 s (5.4 ms/iter)
   * - multigrid ladder 51/101/201
     - **7.8 s**
     - 9.3 s
   * - implicit ``value_and_grad`` (boundary dofs)
     - **17.3 s**
     - 27.8 s
   * - ``least_squares`` opt step (2 nfev)
     - **88.8 s**
     - 151 s

The headline: **a fast desktop CPU beats the A4000 GPU on every production
workflow, even at ns = 201.** Forward solves are close (the GPU is
iteration-competitive at this size — free-boundary NESTOR runs 13.9 ms/iter
on the GPU), but the gradient pipeline is launch-bound on an accelerator,
which is why :func:`vmex.core.device.resolve_implicit_device` pins
implicit-gradient work to the CPU by default (an earlier placement leak
here cost 2x on GPU boxes — fixed, and the pin is now automatic). The
GPU's wins come against slower server cores and larger-than-production
problem sizes (see the GPU guidance below).

Optimization wall time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whole-campaign numbers, from a near-circular torus to a precise
configuration on a 36-core office CPU (details and scripts in
:doc:`optimization`): QA to QS 7.2e-6 in **14.5 min** with a single
ESS-scaled ``least_squares`` call (the staged ``max_mode`` 1–5 ladder
reaches 3.7e-7 in 25.5 min), and QI to a 25x omnigenity-residual reduction
in **17.3 min**. Two measured gradient-stack optimizations make that
possible — the block-tridiagonal implicit Jacobian (33x on the Jacobian
phase) and the perturbation warm start (3.7x fewer trial-solve iterations)
— both on by default and documented in :doc:`optimization`.

Parity with VMEC2000
--------------------

Per-iteration algorithmic parity (same step control, preconditioner cadence,
constants) means the solver does not just reach the same answer — it takes
the *same number of iterations* as VMEC2000 on the benchmark decks:

     - 2000 (capped)
     - 1951
     - both stopped at the matched residual 1.5e-13; a fully converged
       VMEC2000 rerun (fsq ~1e-16) matches the core to <= 7.3e-7 on every
       checked harmonic, in 3197 vs 3118 iterations
   * - li383_low_res (single grid, ns=16)
     - 123
     - within the ±25% parity gate
     -

Parity holds not just at the converged endpoint but along the whole
trajectory.  The trace below runs the quick-start QH case
(``nfp4_QH_warm_start``, single grid at ``ns=51``) through all three codes
and plots the total force residual ``fsqr + fsqz + fsql`` per iteration:
the vmex curve lies exactly on top of VMEC2000's (both converge in 502
iterations), and VMEC++ follows a near-identical path (501 iterations).
The vmex trace comes from ``SolveResult.fsq_history``, the VMEC2000
trace from its stdout iteration table run with ``NSTEP = 1``, and the
VMEC++ trace from the ``fsqt`` array of its wout payload.

.. figure:: _static/figures/readme_convergence.png
   :alt: force residual vs iteration for vmex, VMEC2000, and VMEC++
   :align: center
   :width: 95%

   Force residual vs iteration on ``nfp4_QH_warm_start`` at ``ns=51``
   (``benchmarks/make_readme_figures.py --only convergence``; traces cached
   in ``benchmarks/convergence_nfp4_ns51.json``).

The parity suite additionally asserts, per case: convergence at the deck's
``ftol``; ``wb`` within 1e-7 relative of the golden wout; boundary/interior
``rmnc/zmns`` harmonics at rtol 1e-5; and ``iotaf`` at rtol 1e-5. Where the
golden VMEC2000 run is itself NITER-capped (LandremanPaul QA, the lasym
tokamak), both codes are stopped at a matched residual and the documented
absolute tolerances cover the golden run's own remaining non-convergence.
wout files are compared per-variable with CompareWOut-style combined
rel+abs tolerances.

2D block preconditioner
-----------------------

The default 1D radial preconditioner is what reproduces VMEC2000
iteration-for-iteration. For *stiff* decks — very high aspect ratio or strong
finite-β coupling — an opt-in 2D block preconditioner
(:mod:`vmex.core.preconditioner_2d`) replaces the radial-only approximation
with a matrix-free Newton step: a Jacobian-vector-product Hessian applied
through GMRES (SOLVAX's ``block_thomas_truncated`` / Krylov layer). It cuts the
iteration count 2.5–11x on the stiff cases below, and is a strict add-on — the
default 1D path stays byte-identical, so parity is untouched.

.. figure:: _static/figures/readme_precond.png
   :alt: 2D vs 1D preconditioner iteration counts on stiff cases
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

   Iterations to converge, 2D block vs 1D radial preconditioner
   (``benchmarks/make_readme_figures.py --only precond``).

It is opt-in, not the default, on purpose. Fewer iterations is not fewer
seconds: each 2D Newton step (a GMRES solve over Hessian-vector products) costs
far more than a 1D radial sweep, so the measured wall-clock ranges 0.55–1.16x
across easy and stiff decks — a wash to *slower* (≈2x slower on a plain circular
tokamak, a tie even on the aspect-100 case) — and peak memory is ≈30% higher
(the extra GMRES/HVP compile graph). The converged ``wb`` matches the 1D result
to ~1e-10, so it changes the path, not the fixed point. Reach for it when the
1D iteration count is the bottleneck or stalls, not as a blanket default.

Memory
------

Peak resident memory (0.6–1.5 GB, up to ~3.3 GB on the largest multigrid deck)
is dominated by the transient JAX/XLA *compile* working set, not the
equilibrium data — the spectral state, transform tensors, and solver carry
together are a few MB, and a warm solve's runtime footprint is tens of MB. It
is a per-process, per-resolution compile cost that amortizes across repeated
solves. Two knobs bound the optimization-time footprint:

- The optimization Jacobian is column-chunked (``jac_chunk_size="auto"``, the
  same knob DESC exposes), so peak memory does not scale with the number of
  boundary degrees of freedom.
- Factoring the residual and field pipelines into reusable compiled
  sub-computations cut the implicit-gradient compile ~20% in memory and ~21% in
  wall time, bit-identically (R16).
- The converged-state memo (R25.1) removed a redundant equilibrium
  solve per accepted optimizer iterate and cut the profiled ``opt_step``
  peak RSS from 6.0 to 3.5 GB.

GPU guidance
------------

Measured behavior (``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json``):

- **Per-iteration throughput favours the GPU at every tested size** (0.83 ms
  vs 1.90 ms per iteration at ``ns=35, mpol=2, ntor=2``; up to ~3x on
  NuhrenbergZille-class decks: 90 s vs 277 s wall).
- **The GPU pays fixed per-solve overheads** (~0.2-0.4 s dispatch/transfer
  floor plus compile or cache-load in cold processes), so small decks that
  finish in well under a second of CPU work stay faster on the CPU
  (``solovev``: 0.043 s CPU vs 0.29 s CUDA warm).
- **Fast desktop CPUs change the calculus**: the GPU wins above were
  measured against the office box's slower server cores. Against an idle
  Apple-Silicon CPU, the CPU wins every production workflow even at
  ``ns = 201`` (the table above) — on a modern desktop, treat the GPU as
  an option for very large or heavily batched solves, not a default.

Device policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:mod:`vmex.core.device` encodes this as a default placement rule using
the per-iteration work proxy ``ns * mnmax * nznt`` (the cost driver of the
batched-matmul transforms): below ``GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK = 100_000`` the
solve stays on the CPU, above it the GPU is used. The policy is a *default*
only:

- an explicit ``device=`` argument to ``solve``/``solve_multigrid`` always
  wins;
- ``device=None`` leaves placement to JAX;
- an active ``jax.default_device`` context or a user-pinned JAX platform makes
  the default ``device="auto"`` policy stand down entirely.

.. code-block:: python

   solve(inp, device="cpu")
   solve(inp, device="gpu")
   with jax.default_device(jax.devices("gpu")[0]):
       solve(inp)  # AUTO respects this context

Persistent compilation cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``vmex`` enables JAX's persistent XLA compilation cache on accelerators,
so the multi-second compile cost is paid once per machine, not once per
process.

.. warning::

   **cwd-shadowing pitfall.** Running ``python`` with a working directory
   that contains a ``vmex`` source checkout can shadow the installed
   package as a namespace package: ``vmex/__init__.py`` never runs, the
   persistent compilation cache is never enabled, and every solve pays the
   full XLA recompile (measured ~7 s vs ~1.7 s warm on CUDA for solovev).
   If GPU runs are mysteriously slow, check that
   ``python -c "import vmex; print(vmex.__file__)"`` points where
   you expect.

Float64 is required (enforced at solver import). On GPUs this means fp64
arithmetic, but the solve is latency- rather than FLOP-bound at benchmark
sizes: the tridiagonal preconditioner solve, for instance, measures identical
fp32/fp64 GPU times (~15 us per radial row, independent of the number of
spectral columns).

Reproducing the numbers
-----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   python benchmarks/run_baseline.py         # CPU suite -> benchmarks/baseline.json
   python benchmarks/run_gpu_matrix.py       # GPU matrix -> benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json
   python benchmarks/profile_production.py   # the five production workflows
   pytest tests/test_parity_breadth.py     # end-to-end parity suite

The parity suite needs the golden VMEC2000 fixtures (fetched release assets);
it is skipped automatically when they are unavailable.
