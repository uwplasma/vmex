Performance notes
=================

This page collects practical advice for using ``vmec-jax`` efficiently.

Enable float64
--------------

VMEC2000 is float64-first. For parity, enable x64 in JAX::

  export JAX_ENABLE_X64=1

JIT boundaries and compile latency
----------------------------------

On CPU, compilation can dominate runtime for moderate problem sizes. ``vmec-jax`` uses:

- a jitted geometry kernel (``eval_geom``),
- non-jitted solver gradients by default (to reduce compile latency).

Solver functions accept ``jit_grad=True`` to trade longer compile time for faster
iterations.

Scan-mode iteration (fast path)
-------------------------------

For pure-performance runs (no VMEC2000 control logic), pass ``use_scan=True`` to
``run_fixed_boundary``. This moves the outer iteration loop into ``jax.lax.scan``
and eliminates most Python control-flow + host/device syncs.
Alternatively, use solver ``vmec2000_iter_fast`` (alias ``vmec2000_scan``), which
enables scan mode automatically.
You can also set ``VMEC_JAX_USE_SCAN=1`` to force scan mode for VMEC-style runs.

Important:

- ``use_scan=True`` disables VMEC2000 control features (restart triggers, strict
  update logic, and VMEC-style preconditioner caches). Use it for speed, not
  per-iteration parity.
- Debug dump env vars are incompatible with scan mode.

Recent profiling snapshot (QA, 3 iterations on CPU)
---------------------------------------------------

- Default loop: ~0.26s total wall time (post-warmup).
- Scan loop: ~0.083s total wall time (~3x faster for this short run).

Longer runs benefit more because Python control-flow overhead scales with the
iteration count in the non-scan path.

Static precomputation
---------------------

Use ``VMECStatic`` to avoid rebuilding:

- mode tables,
- angle grids,
- Fourier basis tensors,
- radial grid.

VMEC phase-stack cache
----------------------

The VMEC real-space synthesis path builds full ``(m,n)`` phase tables from the
``fixaray`` trig tables. This is correct but expensive to repeat inside the JIT
kernel. ``VMECStatic`` now precomputes and caches stacked phase tensors for the
VMEC grid (including ``dtheta``/``dzeta`` variants) and attaches them to the
cached trig tables. The precompute uses NumPy on the host to avoid extra JAX
compilation work. This reduces both runtime and compilation work because the
kernel no longer rebuilds the phase tables from scratch every iteration.

Control this behavior with:

- ``VMEC_JAX_CACHE_VMEC_PHASE=1`` (default): precompute phase stacks in
  ``build_static`` for fastest execution.
- ``VMEC_JAX_CACHE_VMEC_PHASE=0``: skip the extra cached tensors to save memory.

Avoid Python objects in jitted functions
----------------------------------------

JAX ``jit`` requires inputs to be arrays or PyTrees. ``vmec-jax`` makes the key
containers PyTrees:

- ``VMECState``
- ``HelicalBasis``
- ``Geom``

If you build your own containers, follow the same approach.

Memory considerations
---------------------

The current Fourier implementation stores ``(K, ntheta, nzeta)`` basis tensors
for cos/sin phases. This is acceptable for low-resolution validation cases, but
will become heavy for larger ``mpol/ntor``.

Planned upgrades (post-parity):

- factorized DFTs (theta/phi separable) using precomputed trig/weight tables,
- FFT-based angular transforms only if they reproduce VMEC scaling and weights,
- chunked evaluation in ``theta``/``zeta`` to reduce peak memory.
