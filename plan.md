# VMEX research-grade plan

## How to use this file (humans and agents)

This plan is self-contained: a contributor should be able to pick any item and implement it
with only this file plus the referenced repos. Conventions:

- **Context.** Main repo `github.com/uwplasma/vmex`, local checkout `~/local/vmex`. PR #123
  (`rj/vmec-extender-field`) merged as `84af4918`; the current audited `main` checkpoint is
  `0362f701` (2026-08-21). Companion repos,
  all local under `~/local/` and on github.com/uwplasma unless noted: `solvax` (=`SOLVAX`,
  case-insensitive FS, installed editable), `NEO_JAX`, `booz_xform_jax`, `virtual_casing_jax`
  (branch `rj/release-0.0.5`), `ESSOS` (PR #58 pairs with vmex #123), `DESC` (PlasmaControl,
  reference only), `STELLOPT` (PrincetonUniversity, fork via rogeriojorge for PRs). Python:
  `/opt/local/bin/python3` (3.11), jax 0.9.2, scipy 1.17.1. GPU box: `ssh office`
  (pop-os, 2x RTX A4000 16 GB). Measured baselines: table below; raw profiling scripts are
  referenced per phase and should be re-run to confirm numbers on the machine at hand.
- **Item IDs.** Reference work as `P<phase>.<item>` (e.g. P3.2). Do not renumber existing items;
  append new ones.
- **Status.** Mark items inline as they change: `[TODO]` (default, unmarked), `[DOING @who]`,
  `[DONE pr#]`, `[BLOCKED reason]`.
- **Log.** Every contribution appends one entry to the `## Log` section at the bottom —
  newest last, never edit or delete prior entries. Format:
  `- YYYY-MM-DD who: P<ids> — what changed / what was measured / PR links / handoff notes.`
  Substantive design changes get a short rationale in the log, and the affected phase text is
  updated in place so the plan body always reflects the current intent.
- **Authorship.** All commits/PRs authored by `rogeriojorge` (git auth); never Claude/Codex
  attribution. PR bodies short and concrete, matching prior rogeriojorge PRs.

Working agreements that apply to every phase:

- All commits, PRs, and PR text are authored by `rogeriojorge` (git auth); never Claude/Codex
  attribution anywhere. PR bodies short, concise, in the style of prior rogeriojorge PRs.
- No scaffolds, testbeds, proxies, or "experimental" lanes survive: code is either wired in and
  certified, or deleted. Prefer fewer lines, fewer files, fewer folders — in source and tests.
- Tests are literature-anchored (papers, other codes, analytic limits), concise, and fast; CI
  stays under 30 minutes while covering >= 95% of lines and all physics/algorithm branches.
- Every performance claim in docs/README is backed by a measured number checked into the
  benchmark JSONs, never prose-only.

Measured baselines backing this plan (Apple Silicon CPU, uncontended, 2026-08-17/18; scripts in
the session scratchpad: `profile_lasym.py`, `fb_isolate.py`, `fb_forward_anatomy.py`,
`fd_tighten.py`, `profile_stall.py`):

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---|
| LASYM vs symmetric per-nfev (max_mode=2, ns=31) | 19.1 s vs 10.4 s (1.8x); jac 5.5x, compile 2.6x |
| LASYM stage-1 (20 nfev) uncontended | ~6-13 min; overnight run descended 25.0 -> 2.64 in 18 its |
| Free-boundary forward (ns=25, mpol=ntor=5) | multigrid 6.2 s; implicit wrapper warm 0.7-9.2 s |
| Free-boundary warm value+grad (136 coil dofs) | ~25 s, adjoint-dominated (unpreconditioned GCROT) |
| Coupled FD-vs-AD error (ns=16 LASYM) | 2.3e-3 warm ftol=1e-7 (current gate 2e-2); **1.5e-4 cold ftol=1e-9** |
| Compile cache | at 1 GiB cap; identical rerun recompiles everything |

## Current checkpoint and interruption-safe handoff (2026-08-21)

This is the authoritative plan in PR #125. **Do not merge or close PR #125**: it is the live
program ledger. **Do not close PR #122**: it is the open alpha-tracing/loss-fraction
specification and implementation branch. Update the phase body when intent changes and append
one dated log entry; do not rely on chat history.

- `main` is current at `0362f701`. The 54 commits after PR #123 comprise ten first-parent PR
  merges (#116, #129, #128, #126, #127, #117, #119, #121, #130, #118), 16 branch-sync merges,
  and 28 direct commits. The independent disposition is recorded in Phase 24.
- The first release worktree is
  `/Users/rogeriojorge/local/vmex-release-0.6-hardening`, branch
  `rj/release-0.6-hardening`, based on `0362f701`. Commit `326ba760` is published for review as
  draft PR #131. It contains the exact implicit-Jacobian contract, CI runtime, 0.6.0 changelog,
  and release-workflow changes. Two-worker JAX contention made the original implicit-response
  lane slower; one serial lane was still too variable, so the unchanged certification set is
  now split by JAX shape into two serial implicit lanes plus one isolated free-boundary-adjoint
  lane. Two consecutive remote runs are fully green with every job below 12 minutes, satisfying
  Phase 25's runtime gate; PR #131 still requires the user's review before merge.
- `/Users/rogeriojorge/local/vmex-release-0.6-essos-audit`, branch
  `rj/release-0.6-essos-audit`, is stacked on #131 at `e977eb20` and published as draft PR #132.
  It preserves the released ESSOS 0.16 contract, explicitly guards nine ESSOS 0.17 previews,
  removes the unreleased CI pin, and restores the stable coil-fixture schema.
- `/Users/rogeriojorge/local/vmex-release-0.6-presf-audit`, branch
  `rj/release-0.6-presf-audit`, is stacked on #132 at `31dd34b2` and published as draft PR #133.
  It adds the missing solved free-boundary pressure-gradient certificate as one approximately
  79-second weekly test. Its review CI is fully green.
- `/Users/rogeriojorge/local/vmex-release-0.6-final`, branch `rj/release-0.6-final`, is stacked
  on #133 at `14553796` and published as draft PR #134. It contains only the 0.6.0
  version/changelog finalization and the source-free wheel/sdist verification matrix. Manual
  dispatch now builds and verifies without publishing; PyPI remains release-event-only. The
  corrected four-way Python 3.10/3.12 wheel/sdist matrix passed in run 32542322776, and PR CI
  plus docs linkcheck are green at this SHA.
- `/Users/rogeriojorge/local/vmex-release-0.6-weekly-ci`, branch
  `rj/release-0.6-weekly-ci`, is stacked on #134 at `a4e4b37f` and published as draft PR #135.
  It replaces the redundant two-hour free-boundary survival stress with the stronger converged
  238-mode VMEC2000 parity contract, splits fixed/free high-mode jobs, preserves the mirror
  refinement tolerances using only the two grids that enter the comparison, and bounds every
  Weekly job to 60 minutes. The first hosted run proved the 50% fine-grid mirror point did not
  fit that bound, so it remains in the 0--80% coarse continuation while the fine-grid
  certificate covers the promoted 0--10% range. The second hosted run passed that mirror job
  in 55:01 but proved the 15->25 high-mode free-boundary ladder too variable for the same bound.
  Head `a4e4b37f` changes only the radial ladder to 11->19; the local VMEX run and independent
  VMEC2000 oracle both converge with the same 238 modes, vacuum activation, restart and 1e-8
  tolerance. PR run 32554820509 is fully green (longest direct job 10:50), and final Weekly run
  32554856698 passed adjoint/fixed/mirror/free in 4:45/16:17/47:54/56:43, all below the
  60-minute per-job bound. Review and merge #131 first, then retarget/review #132, #133, #134
  and #135 in order; keep all five scopes separate and do not squash them together.
- `/Users/rogeriojorge/local/vmex` is clean relative to `main` except for user-owned untracked
  beta-bootstrap output assets and an older untracked `plan.md`; preserve them. The PR #125
  copy of this file is authoritative.
- Current public software release: VMEX 0.5.0. GitHub incorrectly points `/releases/latest` at
  the documentation-assets release `assets-20260812-wout-fixtures`. Phase 23 makes 0.6.0 the
  next software release and the latest release without deleting provenance assets.
- Current dependency releases: ESSOS 0.16, virtual_casing_jax 0.0.5, NEO_JAX 1.0.2,
  SOLVAX 0.12.0, and booz_xform_jax 0.1.1. ESSOS #58 and #61 are green but open, so their code
  is not a released dependency and must not be described as complete. They require independent
  ESSOS maintainer review and merge; VMEX contributors do not merge them, and they are scheduled
  last rather than blocking VMEX 0.6.0.

Resume in this order: read this checkpoint and the newest log entry; dispatch an uncontended
replacement for cancelled GPU run 32543384593 once both office GPUs are free;
review #131; retarget and review #132, #133, #134 and #135 in order; then execute the remaining
tag/publish/latest verification gates in Phase 23.
Never infer completion from a local diff, an open sibling PR, or a green microbenchmark.

## Research-grade completion map

The detailed phases below remain the source of truth. This map prevents an earlier requirement
from being lost when work moves between repositories.

| Goal | Owning phases | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed/free-boundary VMEC parity, convergence, restart, axis and mirror robustness | P3, P3b, P8, P18, P23 | VMEC2000/VMEC++ parity, typed failures, converged vacuum/finite-beta symmetric/LASYM and mirror cases |
| Exact, composable derivatives for residual and scalar optimizers | P1, P22, P24 | fail-closed certificates, JVP/VJP identity, independent FD/reference checks, SciPy/JAX scalar and residual contracts |
| QA/QH/QP/QI, max-J, bootstrap, well, Mercier/Glasser and gradient-scale objectives | P5, P6, P12-P14, P16-P19, P27 | physics-oracle tests plus short descending examples using the common tuple API |
| Effective ripple, trapped fraction, gamma-c, J contours and alpha loss | P6, P7, P21, P26, P27 | independent NEO/DESC/STELLOPT/literature parity and differentiable objective gates |
| Interior/exterior field API, virtual casing, tracing and fixed/free single-stage coils | P3-P4, P11, P13, P15, P21, P26 | B/gradB/VJP and tracing certificates, ESSOS/VC ownership, end-to-end coil examples |
| CPU/GPU/HPC performance with bounded memory | P2-P3, P7-P9, P11, P25 | checked-in benchmark records, profiled kernels, CI budgets and GPU memory/runtime gates |
| Clear examples, CLI, README and full documentation | P4, P10, P13-P16, P21, P23, P27 | executable examples, concise README, equations/tutorials/reference pages and link checks |
| Slim, maintainable ecosystem and reproducible releases | P9-P10, P15, P23, P26-P27 | ownership boundaries, net-LOC discipline, >=95% coverage, clean artifacts and release checklist |

No row is complete merely because one representative example passes. Research-grade completion
means the stated symmetry, pressure, boundary-condition, device, and reference-code matrix is
covered at the cheapest resolution that still exercises the real physics; production-scale
campaigns belong in bounded nightly/weekly jobs, not every pull request.

## Phase 0 — Unblock and merge PR #123 (`rj/vmec-extender-field`)  [DONE — merged 2026-08-19 as 84af4918]

Smallest possible diff to green; everything else moves to the new branch off `main`.

1. Ruff: `E701` in `examples/optimization/QA_optimization.py:65` (split the one-liner `if`);
   `F541` in `examples/optimization/QA_optimization_global.py:71` (drop the `f` prefix).
2. Add `tests/test_neoclassical.py` to `tests/manifest.json` (pick a lane that runs it so the
   changed-line coverage gate sees `vmex/core/neoclassical.py`).
3. Fix `tests/test_examples.py::test_vacuum_qs_examples_expose_trial_pressure_terms` to point at
   `QA_optimization_DMerc_vacuum.py` (where `USE_TRIAL_STABILITY` now lives); update the matching
   pointer in `docs/reference/objectives.rst`.
4. Docs linkcheck: replace `https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/advanced-autodiff.html` (404) with
   `https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html` in `docs/project/references`.
5. Pin `scipy>=1.15` in `pyproject.toml` (all eight asymmetry examples + both maxJ continuations
   use `least_squares(..., callback=)`, added in SciPy 1.15).
6. Merge PR #123. Open the new working branch from `main`; all phases below land there in
   focused PRs.

Acceptance: PR CI fully green (quality, coverage gate, linkcheck), PR merged.

## Phase 1 — Examples run honestly (the "stall" fix)  [PARTIAL; exactness continues in P22]

Current disposition: flushed progress, monitor de-duplication, bounded diagnostics and the
measured stall investigation are merged. The temporary policy that returned a bounded but
uncertified response is not an acceptable final “exact derivative” contract; Phase 22 supersedes
that policy with certified fallback or a typed error. Keep the measurements below as diagnosis,
not as permission to expose an approximate Jacobian.

Diagnosis (instrumented reproduction, `profile_stall.py`, uncontended): the examples descend
(overnight log: 18 iterations, cost 25.0 -> 2.64) and healthy iterations cost ~10-12 s
(residual re-solve 8-10 s, Jacobian 1.8-3.9 s). The stall is real and has FOUR components, now
measured:
(a) **Pathological Jacobian evaluations — the dominant cost, and it is systematic.** Full-stage
    measurement (LASYM QA, max_mode=2, 48 dofs): jac #1-2 take 1.8-3.9 s, then EVERY Jacobian
    from iterate ~3 on takes ~2000-2240 s (~35 min; ~42 s per dof column vs ~0.2 s early) while
    residual re-solves stay at 3.5 s. Stack sample: main thread blocked in a single XLA
    `Execute` (`BlockUntilReady`) — the per-dof implicit linear solves inside `jac_jit` grind
    once the iterate moves away from the reference/compile point (frozen preconditioner/tcon
    quality? hot-restart seed distance?), i.e. degradation is persistent, not an unlucky trial. All 48 dof solves
    share one operator `dF/dz(z*)`: make the factor-once amortized block-Thomas path
    (`solvax.block_thomas_factor/solve`, already documented in `optimize.py`) the default for
    ndof over a small threshold, keep per-dof GMRES as fallback, cap inner iterations with a
    typed diagnostic instead of silent grinding, and emit a heartbeat (`jax.experimental.
    io_callback`) so a long Jacobian is visibly alive. Observed blowup is ~500x (one jac
    execution > 30 min CPU-bound vs 2-4 s healthy), which exceeds any plausible GMRES-maxiter
    factor — also audit whether the jitted Jacobian program re-runs the full equilibrium
    while_loop (forward_max_iterations=2000) per dof column at unlucky iterates instead of
    reusing the converged donated state; that recomputation, 48x over, matches the magnitude.
    First step of the fix PR: an instrumented jac lane that reports per-column inner-solve
    iteration counts and solve/linearize split (io_callback), run at the captured bad iterate
    (the profiler saves x per call, `scratchpad/profile_stall.py`).
(b) **Mid-loop recompile churn**: `jit(_block_lane)` (+`jit(copy)`) recompiles ~3 s apiece
    *inside* residual re-solves (`jax_log_compiles` captured pairs of `_block_lane` compiles per
    hot-restart solve at identical shapes `f64[31,50]`) — jit identity instability
    (`solver.py:1760` lambda/closure) and/or eviction; fix the callable identity, then Phase 2.
(c) **Unflushed output**: scipy prints one row per iteration; everything else sat in the 8 KiB
    buffer (fixes below).
(d) macOS sleep/App Nap throttling long unattended runs (document `caffeinate -i`).
Then fix all of the following:

1. **Flush everywhere.** Flip the five `emit=print` defaults to the existing
   `printing.emit_flushed` (`solver.py:2119`, `multigrid.py:244`, `multigrid.py:564`,
   `freeboundary.py:1568`, `freeboundary.py:2194`); add `flush=True` at `monitoring.py:71,462,466`
   and `bootstrap.py:1039`; document `python -u` in `examples/README.md`.
2. **Per-nfev progress.** `VmecProblem` gains an opt-in progress line per residual/Jacobian call
   (timestamped, flushed) so a 40 s evaluation is visibly alive; the examples enable it. This is
   the direct answer to "stuck at iteration 1 for several minutes".
3. **Kill the monitor double-solve.** `OptimizationMonitor._term_costs` re-calls
   `problem.residual(x)` per accepted iterate (`monitoring.py:233-243`); reuse the cached residual
   from the accepted evaluation (term slices are already in `problem.metadata`).
4. **Long-run ergonomics.** Examples print a one-line budget estimate per stage (measured
   per-nfev cost x max_nfev); `examples/README.md` documents `caffeinate -i python -u ...` for
   multi-hour runs on macOS; outputs go to an ignored `results/` directory instead of the CWD.
5. **CI executes the examples.** Nightly lane runs at least QA + QI asymmetry in
   `VMEX_EXAMPLES_CI=1` smoke mode asserting descent (final cost < initial). None of the eight
   currently executes anywhere.
6. **`jax_explain_cache_misses` crash (found while profiling the stall).** Setting
   `jax.config.update("jax_explain_cache_misses", True)` deterministically kills any vmex solve
   with `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected at least 3, got 2)`, surfacing at the
   first jit under the flag (`solvax/tridiagonal.py:203` `lax.platform_dependent`, reached from
   `vmex/core/preconditioner.py:689`). Bisected: the flag alone is the trigger (base /
   `jax_log_compiles` / custom cache dir all pass); import order and x64 are fine
   (`_compat.py:222` env + `solver.py:71` hard-set — verified). Actions: minimal repro
   (`platform_dependent` under the flag on jax 0.9.2) -> upstream JAX issue; until fixed, Phase 2
   cache diagnosis uses `jax_log_compiles` + cache-size accounting instead of miss explanations,
   and `vmex --doctor` warns if the flag is set. Note for anyone debugging: running Python from
   `~/local` (the repo's *parent*) shadows `vmex` as an empty namespace package — imports fail
   loudly, but don't chase that as a bug.

Acceptance: interactive stage-1 run shows a flushed, timestamped line at least every ~30 s;
profile shows zero mid-stage recompiles; nightly smoke lane green.

## Phase 2 — Compilation cache policy  [PARTIAL: sizing + doctor DONE; the real cost is elsewhere]

Today: machine-scoped persistent cache (`_compat.py`) capped at 1 GiB; the cache sits exactly at
the cap and an identical rerun recompiles everything — the cap forces eviction churn, and
`pure_callback` identities may be poisoning keys.

1. Diagnose with `jax_log_compiles` + cache-directory accounting (file count/bytes/atimes before
   and after) across two identical example runs; classify misses (evicted vs key-unstable). Do
   NOT use `jax_explain_cache_misses` — it crashes vmex solves on jax 0.9.2 (Phase 1.6). If
   callbacks poison keys, hoist them so cached jits close over stable callables (module-level,
   config-keyed) rather than per-call closures.
2. Policy: default cap sized to hardware — `min(20 GiB, 10% of free disk)` with LRU eviction,
   overridable by the existing `VMEX_COMPILATION_CACHE_*` env vars; document one knob, not many.
   Rationale: single VMEX executables reach tens-hundreds of MB; a working set of one user's
   examples is several GiB; 20 GiB fits any state-of-the-art workstation, the disk-fraction guard
   protects small laptops. GPU adds its own kernels — same policy, separate per-backend fingerprint
   directory (already in place).
3. Add a `vmex --doctor` line: cache dir, size vs cap, hit rate of the last run (JAX exposes
   miss explanations; a simple counter in `_compat` suffices).
4. Regression test: build the same small problem twice in two subprocesses; assert the second
   compile time is < 25% of the first (skip on CI runners without a persistent HOME).

Acceptance: identical example rerun compiles in seconds, not 30-140 s; doctor reports cache
health; test pins it.

## Phase 3 — Free-boundary speed and accuracy (explicit plan)

Target: warm value+grad at example scale (ns=25, 136 coil dofs) from ~25 s to <= 8 s CPU, with the
exact certificate untouched, and a GPU lane that beats CPU. The Schur direct lane remains the
exact fallback; the default lane becomes preconditioned + recycled.

1. **Instrument first**: land `adjoint_matvec_count`-style counters in `_host_adjoint`
   (matvecs/gradient, mean matvec time) so before/after is a number in the PR body.
2. **Precondition the certified GCROT lane.** Pass `M ~= (A^T)^-1` to `gcrotmk` in
   `_host_adjoint` (`freeboundary_implicit.py:725`), where `A` is the frozen block-tridiagonal
   bulk already assembled by `im._raw_block_system` for the Schur lane. Factor once per gradient
   with `solvax.block_thomas_factor(store_offdiagonals=False, factor_dtype=float32)` (0.13
   reusable factors: 3-6x less factor memory); float64 refinement stays in the Krylov loop. Since
   `E = J - A` is edge-low-rank, expect O(10-30) preconditioned matvecs vs O(100+) today.
3. **Wire in `freeboundary_linear.py` as the preconditioner backbone** (disposition: wire in, not
   delete). `NestorBorderedOperator.preconditioner(plasma_solve, schur_solve)` is the block
   inverse `M`; the two adapters it needs already exist in `tests/test_freeboundary.py:162-176`
   (a `vacuum_system(x)` from `solver_vac.assemble`, and a `plasma_residual(x, q)` with explicit
   potential). This makes the bordered operator load-bearing production code with its existing
   2e-12 linearization tests as the unit certificate.
4. **Recycle Krylov subspaces across optimizer trials.** Persist the GCROT deflation space
   (scipy `CU=`/`discard_C`, or move the host lane to `solvax.gcrot` with `recycle` and surface
   `recycle_drift` in `LinearResponseReport` — resolving the stale doc claim by using it).
   Store next to the warm state in the config-keyed hot cache.
5. **SOLVAX/VMEX split** (companion solvax PR): solvax gains a generic bordered-operator type and
   a low-rank-update preconditioned/recycled GCROT policy; vmex keeps NESTOR residual assembly,
   Fourier/edge constraints (m=1 pairing), coil-to-boundary maps, and the physics certificate.
6. **Certificates unchanged in math, tightened in tolerance** (Phase 3b below). Every adjoint
   still checked against the true coupled transpose at `10 x adjoint_tol x ||rhs||`; Schur direct
   lane kept as exact fallback and as the cross-check in tests.
7. **GPU lane (office box, 2x RTX A4000 16 GB).** Profile cold compile memory and steady-state
   on GPU with the XLA profiler (`jax.profiler.trace` -> perfetto; `nsys` if kernel-level needed).
   Gate: one coupled value+grad on GPU within 16 GB and faster than CPU warm. The reusable
   float32 factors and the preconditioned lane are exactly what shrinks the GPU footprint.
8. **Forward-solve iteration budget.** Free-boundary forward runs 1193 its where fixed runs 141
   at the same size (8.5x iteration ratio, 2.2x per-iteration cost). Investigate vacuum-refresh
   cadence (`ivacskip` analogue) and preconditioner reuse across vacuum updates for a further
   forward win; any change must keep wout parity tests green.

Acceptance: matvecs/gradient reduced >= 3x with certificate green; warm value+grad <= 8 s CPU at
example scale; GPU value+grad runs in 16 GB and beats CPU; no test tolerances loosened.

## Phase 3b — Coupled FD certificate at research grade

Measured: the FD noise floor is the solver endpoint, not the adjoint. Cold re-solves + ftol=1e-9
gives 1.5e-4 agreement; warm probes at tight ftol are corrupted by hysteresis (6.8e-2); below the
reachable ftol the root itself wanders.

1. Rewrite `test_free_boundary_current_gradient_matches_resolve_finite_difference`: cold
   re-solves (pop `_FREE_HOT_CACHE` per probe), forward ftol=1e-9 (niter to reach it), h=2e-4,
   assert the forward actually attained ftol, add a noise control (two identical cold re-solves;
   require |delta objective| << h x |derivative|), gate at **rtol=1e-3** (6x margin over measured).
2. Same protocol for the boundary-Schur certificate (from 5e-2 to 1e-3).
3. Add one coil-shape-dof FD certificate (not just `extcur`): a single ESSOS geometry dof through
   `field_from_parameters`, same protocol, `full`-marked.
4. Document the endpoint-noise physics in `docs/explanation/adjoint-gradients.md` (why warm FD
   probes lie; why Richardson amplifies noise here).

Acceptance: both certificates gate at 1e-3, nightly runtime <= 10 min combined, and fail if the
forward stalls above the requested ftol instead of silently passing.

## Phase 4 — Community API: `FreeBoundaryProblem.from_tuples`

`optimize.py`/`problem.py` have zero `lfreeb` support today; the two 150-line examples are the API.

1. New `FreeBoundaryProblem` mirroring `VmecProblem`: same objective tuples, plus
   `coils=` (ESSOS `Coils` | `MgridField` | `extcur` array), `coil_dofs=` filter,
   `coil_terms=` engineering objectives, optional `boundary_max_mode=` for joint
   boundary+coil dofs (virtual-casing lane), `ns/ftol/adjoint_tol`, built-in smooth
   rejected-trial wall, unit scaling, `dof_names`, monitor term slices,
   `compile_value_and_gradient()`.
2. Rewrite both single-stage free-boundary examples to ~40 lines on top of it; keep the current
   API calls only in the how-to as the "under the hood" appendix.
3. Tests: construction/validation guards; value+grad equals the hand-rolled pipeline bit-for-bit
   on the smoke config; descent smoke (2 L-BFGS iterations); joint boundary+coil dof path;
   docs how-to `howto/optimize-free-boundary-coils.md` + tutorial `first-free-boundary.md`.
4. Retire the "experimental" label via the capability-JSON tripwire
   (`test_capability_docs` pins the exact wording — update JSON + generator in lockstep) once
   Phase 3/3b acceptance holds.

Acceptance: an end-user drives a free-boundary coil optimization in <= 40 lines; class fully
tested; capability table says supported (CPU), GPU status stated honestly.

## Phase 5 — Full LASYM  [5a and 5d DONE; 5b, 5c open]

### 5a. vmex bugs (immediate, ship with Phase 0 follow-up)
- `MaximumJResidual.compute_state` (`maxj.py:543-549`) and the shared dict in
  `qi_and_maximum_j_from_boozer` (`maxj.py:387-390`) drop `bmns_b`: the maxJ certificate
  silently symmetrizes LASYM fields. Fix both; add a parametrized regression across all five
  bounce classes (nonzero `bmns_b` must change the residual; `bmns=None` == `bmns=0` bit-exact).

### 5b. vmex hard guards, in order
1. `virtual_casing._state_field_spectra` (`virtual_casing.py:346-351`): add the sine-parity
   contravariant-B spectra (jnp clone of `nyquist.wrout_sin_coeffs`, full-theta grid, LASYM
   `tmult` normalization — all patterns exist in `nyquist.py`). Geometry half already computes
   `rmns/zmnc`. This unblocks LASYM live-state virtual casing; note
   `PlasmaVacuumInterface.from_wout` already works for LASYM today.
2. `extender.py`: thread the sine families through `_flux_coordinates_to_xyz` and
   `_interior_coordinates_and_B` (currently zero `lasym` handling — would silently drop them).
3. `l_grad_b` wout lane (`optimize.py:723`) and `_lgradb_state_tables`
   (`statephysics.py:570`): plumbing only, arrays already exist.
4. Ballooning/turbulence (`stability.py:628`): larger (asymmetric-lambda PEST inversion);
   either schedule after 1-3 or keep the guard and state it as a deliberate limit in the
   capability table — no silent middle ground.
- `virtual_casing_jax` itself needs **no math changes** (vmex passes full-period grids,
  `half_period=False` hardcoded). Two small hygiene PRs there (authored rogeriojorge): honour or
  document the write-only `stellsym` field; relax the inherited simsopt-lane guard that is
  stricter than the code beneath it.

### 5c. NEO_JAX LASYM (own PR in NEO_JAX, merge when validated)
~150 lines of plumbing: add `rmns/zmnc/lmnc/bmns` + static `lasym` to `BoozerData`; ingest the
sine variables in all three `io.py` constructors (`lmnc = -pmnc_b*nfp/2pi`, `sqrtg00 = gmnc+gmns`);
forward through both drivers' coeff dicts; make the B-max tie-breaker sine-aware (or route LASYM
to the jax argmax path). The asymmetric Fourier kernel already exists and matches
`neo_fourier.f90` term for term — it is currently dead code. Validation: asymmetric boozmn
fixture + parity test against **patched** xneo (see 5d) or the STELLOPT in-memory path; the
booz_xform_jax side of the comparison uses the corrected/fixed xbooz reference. Then lift the
guard in `vmex/core/neoclassical.py:86` and add a LASYM eps_eff panel test.

### 5d. STELLOPT upstream PRs (fork `rogeriojorge/STELLOPT`, small and separate)
1. PR 1 [DONE: PrincetonUniversity/STELLOPT#501] — NEO boozmn reader: `NEO/Sources/read_booz_in.f90:143` `bmns(i,i)` -> `bmns(i,k)`
   (corrupts the asymmetric |B| spectrum; the in-memory `stellopt_neo.f90:226` copy is correct,
   proving the typo). Body: 3-4 sentences, the diff speaks.
2. PR 2 [DONE: PrincetonUniversity/STELLOPT#502] — NEO deallocation bugs: `neo_dealloc.f90:49-50` frees `pixn`/`i_n` while testing
   `pixm`/`i_m` (leaks both), and the LASYM arrays `rmns/zmnc/lmnc/bmns` are never freed.
3. Keep local patches in the fork until merged; generate all LASYM reference data with the
   patched reader only.

Acceptance: all four vmex boundary families first-class in virtual casing/extender/l_grad_b (or
explicitly gated in the capability table); NEO_JAX LASYM merged with Fortran parity at documented
tolerance; both STELLOPT PRs open.

## Phase 6 — Epsilon effective: surface-integral objective lane  [6.8 plot fix DONE; the lane itself open]

Adopt the surface-integral reformulation (Paul et al. JPP 2020 Eq. 6.1; DESC and KNOSOS are both
instances): many short field-line transits x pitch grid, all independent, all fixed-shape.

1. **New `vmex/core/ripple.py`** built on what exists: `boozer_bmnc_state` (traceable Boozer,
   LASYM included) + the differentiable bounce kernel (`bounce.py`, sin-map Gauss quadrature).
   Extend `trace_boozer_field_lines` with the two dB einsums so
   `|grad psi| kappa_G = (I dB/dzeta - G dB/dtheta)/(G + iota I)` — no Boozer geometry harmonics
   needed. Pitch grid: 1/lambda uniform in B on (Bmin, Bmax), open-Simpson weights (~48-64 nodes;
   DESC `get_pitch_inv_quad` is the reference). Generalize `bounce_action` to the Nemov (H, I)
   pair sharing bounce points; assemble with `safediv`; normalize by the flux-surface-average
   line length (DESC `_neoclassical.py:225-262` pattern). `<|grad psi|>` and `R0` from vmex's own
   traceable half-mesh tables.
2. **Objective class** mirroring `QIResidual` (`residuals_state` duck type) so it drops into
   `from_tuples` and `jac="implicit"` unchanged. Register in `optimize.__all__`.
3. **Gradients fast and small**: reverse-mode works out of the box (fixed shapes); memory by
   `solvax.chunk_map` over pitch + `jax.checkpoint` per chunk (DESC's chunking-not-remat
   strategy); B-extrema roots via `solvax.root_solve` (IFT, no while_loop). For the implicit
   least-squares driver only JVPs are needed — already chunked.
4. **Smoothness for optimization**: fixed `max_wells` with NaN-honest sentinels but a smooth
   pitch/well weighting (softplus margins where a hard max would kink); verify objective
   smoothness by plotting eps_eff along a boundary-coefficient ray.
5. **Independent parity ladder (several comparisons, then claim parity):**
   - analytic tokamak limit: `B = B0(1 - eps_t cos theta)` -> eps_eff = eps_t to quadrature order;
   - STELLOPT NEO (patched xneo) at production resolution on the repo's QA/QH/QI/QP wouts,
     symmetric and LASYM, 1-3% (NEO's own acc_req bounds tighter claims);
   - NEO_JAX (post 5c) at matched `NeoConfig` — never default-vs-default (50x different problem);
   - DESC `EffectiveRipple` on a shared equilibrium (extend the existing
     `test_matches_desc_bounce1d_when_available` pattern);
   - convergence scans in (nalpha, num_transit, npitch, quad order, max_wells) with the
     num_transit x nalpha equivalence check.
6. **Gradient validation**: JVP/VJP transpose identity; jacfwd vs grad; central FD through the
   full implicit chain on one boundary coefficient (Phase 3b protocol).
7. **Example** `examples/optimization/QA_eps_eff_optimization.py` following the standard
   template (stages, monitor, report, plots), and a finite-beta variant flag.
8. **Plot fixes (land early, independent of the lane):** summary-panel eps_eff with more surfaces
   once fast (12-16), explicit `set_ylim(0.5*min, 2*max)` + minor log ticks so the minimum is
   always visible, clearer LASYM-unavailable note until 5c lands, and the same axis policy in
   `examples/epsilon_effective.py`.

Performance target: < 1 s/surface CPU, ~10-50 ms/surface GPU steady-state (DESC demonstrates the
regime); reverse-mode gradient at O(1) memory in dof count.

Acceptance: parity table (5 independent comparisons) in docs; optimization example descends and
is smoke-run in CI; gradient certificates green; wout-lane NEO_JAX diagnostic retained as the
independent cross-check, not deleted.

## Phase 7 — NEO_JAX speedups (companion PRs in NEO_JAX + solvax)

Priority order (each an independent, measurable PR):
1. Real early exit from the period scan (bounded two-pass scheme; up to 4x on converged cases).
2. Vectorize the trapped-class deposit: `segment_sum`/one-hot matmul replaces the per-step
   `fori_loop`+`cond` scatter (~1e7 serialized scalar ops per surface today).
3. Fourier as GEMM via `cos(m theta - n phi)` separability: kills the (theta x phi x mode)
   temporaries — measured 4.45 GB -> tens of MB — and obsoletes the streamed mode switch.
4. `dynamic_slice` spline gathers (16 coefficients, not a 4x4xphi_n slab, ~2.4e6 times/surface).
5. solvax offload: `splper`/`splreg` -> `cyclic_tridiagonal_solve`/`tridiagonal_solve` (deletes
   ~180 lines of ported index arithmetic); extrema Newton -> `solvax.root_solve` (restores
   reverse-mode); surface batching -> `chunk_map`; make `acc_req` traced, hoist the per-call jit.
6. Run down the NCSX 0.5% epstot discrepancy (rtol 6e-3 fast gate vs 2.5e-10 headline) **before**
   any change that reorders floating-point sums; re-baseline tolerances deliberately.
New solvax primitives (own PRs, in value order): bounded `scan_while` with reverse rule; batched
2-D spline coefficient builder; masked segment accumulator.

Acceptance: NCSX 200x200 case >= 5x faster than today at unchanged parity tolerances; memory
< 500 MB; discrepancy explained and pinned.

## Phase 8 — Performance program across all lanes + VMEC2000/VMEC++ comparisons  [first CPU rows measured; see the machine-gap log entry]

1. **Benchmark matrix** (one JSON, one nightly job): {fixed, free} x {lasym on/off} x
   {tokamak, stellarator} x {vacuum, finite beta} x {CPU, GPU office A4000}: wall time, its,
   ms/it, peak RSS, and for gradient lanes: s/gradient and matvecs. Extend
   `benchmarks/baseline.json` + `render_performance_docs.py` so docs numbers regenerate.
2. **VMEC2000** (local STELLOPT build) and **VMEC++** (github.com/proximafusion/vmecpp, pip
   installable) in a separate venv: run the shared input decks, compare wout parity (iota, beta,
   Mercier, |B| spectra) and wall time. Accuracy first: any VMEX-vs-VMEC2000 discrepancy beyond
   the documented parity contract is a bug before it is a benchmark. Study their speed sources —
   VMEC2000: radial-block MPI parallelism + serial hot loops in Fortran; VMEC++: C++ with
   OpenMP-style threading and zero-restart multigrid — and write down which techniques transfer
   (radial blocking maps to batched linear algebra; their vacuum refresh cadence policies map to
   Phase 3.8).
3. **Single-device speed**: profile the fixed-boundary iteration (5.2 ms/it free, 2.3 ms/it
   fixed at ns=25) to the XLA level (perfetto trace on CPU and A4000); attack the top kernels
   (fusion breaks, transposes, callback boundaries). LASYM Jacobian 5.5x -> target <= 3x via
   chunked JVP sizing and shared trig tables.
4. **Multi-CPU**: document and test `solve_ensemble` scaling; investigate radial-block sharding
   of the 1-D preconditioner (solvax block-Thomas is the natural seam) for single-solve
   multi-core strong scaling; measure, do not promise.
5. **Multi-GPU**: only after single-GPU is clean; sharded ensembles first (embarrassingly
   parallel scans are the realistic strong-scaling story), single-solve sharding recorded as an
   explicit non-goal unless the profile says otherwise.
6. Derivative cost/memory targets recorded per lane: fixed-boundary Jacobian s/dof, free-boundary
   s/gradient, eps_eff s/gradient — all in the benchmark JSON with regressions gated in nightly.

Acceptance: benchmark matrix in CI nightly with regression gates; a docs page with measured
VMEX vs VMEC2000 vs VMEC++ parity + runtime tables; at least one demonstrated strong-scaling
curve (ensembles) and honest statements elsewhere.

## Phase 9 — CI: >= 95% coverage, < 30 min, literature-anchored  [changed-line gate DONE at 96%]

1. Coverage gate moves from changed-lines to whole-repo >= 95% (line + branch on `vmex/core`),
   with per-module floors so physics modules cannot hide behind plotting.
2. Time budget: pull-request critical path <= 15 min and scheduled nightly <= 30 min. Start
   selected heavy lanes at measured `-n 2`, keep memory/cache-sensitive mirror lanes serial,
   and raise worker count only after RSS and wall-time evidence. Levers:
   the Phase 2 cache (compile time dominates test wall), smaller `full`-equivalent decks (the
   FD certificates at ns=8-16 are minutes, not tens of minutes), manifest-driven sharding across
   jobs, and pruning duplicate-coverage tests when slimming (Phase 10) — fewer, sharper tests.
3. Every new physics test cites its anchor (paper/code/analytic limit) in the docstring —
   Goodman JPP 2023 (maxJ/QI), Nemov PoP 1999 + Paul JPP 2020 (eps_eff), VMEC2000/DCON/GPEC
   (Mercier), patched STELLOPT NEO (ripple parity). Edge cases enumerated per objective:
   axis limit, lasym on/off, vacuum vs finite beta, near-rational iota, degenerate |B|.
4. `ConstructedMaximumJResidual` test set (currently zero): class==functional bit-exact with a
   monkeypatched Boozer dict; `bmns_b` forwarding regression across all five bounce classes;
   input guards; symmetric-limit bit-equivalence; Goodman g_J continuation target vs the
   independent NumPy reference lineage already in `test_qi_reference_oracle.py`; grad-vs-FD +
   traced-weights JVP + one `full` implicit boundary gradient; composition consistency with
   `ConstructedQIResidual`; NaN-not-zero degenerate-regime contract.
5. Soften the eps_eff test docstring's "NEO/STELLOPT-parity" claim until Phase 6's independent
   comparisons exist; then reinstate it with the parity table as evidence.

Acceptance: coverage >= 95% enforced; pull-request critical path <= 15 min; nightly <= 30 min;
every physics test names its anchor. Phase 25 carries the current timing evidence and changes.

## Phase 10 — Slim code, docs, and repository  [PARTIAL: stale claims, dead code, examples index DONE]

1. **Scaffold disposition (execute the verdicts):** wire in `freeboundary_linear.py` (Phase 3);
   delete `freeboundary_diff.py` shim after fixing its one real caller
   (`tools/build_qi_sheet_mgrid.py:86`); delete the `vmec_jax/` package shim on schedule
   (update `pyproject.toml:108`, `test_packaging_metadata`, README); delete the
   `FreeBoundaryDiffProblem` alias; strip `_compat._env`'s legacy `VMEC_JAX_*` branch; either
   consume `recycle_drift` (Phase 3.4) or delete the doc sentences; quantify the trial-pressure
   proxy (accuracy study vs re-solved finite-beta over a beta scan) so "trial" carries an error
   bar, or fold it into the standard Mercier docs as a screening tool with stated bounds.
2. **LOC/file budget:** every PR states net LOC; refactors that delete (NEO_JAX splines via
   solvax, Fourier GEMM removing the streamed mode, examples on `FreeBoundaryProblem`) are
   preferred over additions. Test suite consolidation: merge single-assert modules into their
   physics-area files where it does not hurt manifest sharding.
3. **Docs correctness sweep** (12 verified stale claims with corrected wording ready):
   the three LASYM claims (`optimize.py:54`, `confinement.rst:285`, `confinement.rst:428`),
   `all-of-vmex.md:94` denying the free-boundary adjoint, the plot-diagnostics D_R
   misattribution, `objectives.rst:164` lasym parenthetical, `objectives.rst:418` +
   `README.md:234` trial-pressure pointers, `recycle_drift`, the dead JAX URL, the pre-rename
   SVG text, the stale cloc table. README linkcheck added to the workflow paths.
4. **README restructure:** lead with "what VMEX does that VMEC2000/VMEC++ do not" (exact implicit
   derivatives, free-boundary adjoint, LASYM optimization, differentiable objectives incl.
   eps_eff, CPU+GPU); LASYM and free-boundary single-stage sections with figures; comparison
   matrix reordered differentiators-first. New how-tos: free-boundary coils, asymmetric boundary,
   effective ripple, field-line tracing, exterior field queries (add `compute/trace/query` to
   `HOWTO_VERBS` or retitle); `first-free-boundary` tutorial. Respect the 150 KB/file media gate:
   new figures as ~1600 px WebP.
5. **Repo slimming:** re-encode the 4 oversized figures (~1.26 MB saved; then remove them from
   `GRANDFATHERED_FILES` to tighten the gate); delete orphan `ess_x_scale.png`; examples write to
   `results/`.
6. **Git history rewrite:** after the above land and a release is tagged — rewrite history to
   drop dead blobs (pre-rename `vmec_jax/` trees, superseded figures; 46 MB `.git` for an 8.8 MB
   tree). Do it once, deliberately: `git filter-repo` keeping the tagged release reachable,
   force-push, announce that users must re-clone; pin the old HEAD sha in the release notes for
   provenance.

Acceptance: zero "experimental"/scaffold language in the source; net-negative LOC for the
refactor PRs; docs claims spot-checked against code in CI (`check_docs_prose` extended with the
capability cross-check); fresh clone <= ~15 MB.

## Phase 11 — Virtual-casing performance and memory (single-stage finite-beta OOM)

Symptom: `single_stage_optimization_finite_beta.py` (the specified-boundary virtual-casing lane,
`PlasmaVacuumInterface`) is slow, and users OOM when raising boundary modes, coil count, or coil
dofs. The dense virtual-casing kernel scales as (src_nt x src_np) x (trg_nt x trg_np) and the
whole graph is differentiated with plain reverse-mode, so memory grows with every mode/coil.

1. **Measure first.** Memory/runtime matrix of one value+grad over
   {max_mode 2,4,6} x {4,8,16 coils} x {nphi,ntheta 32,48,64}: peak RSS, wall, and the XLA
   allocation report (`JAX_LOG_COMPILES` + `jax.profiler.save_device_memory_profile`). Identify
   whether the OOM is the VC kernel tableau, the ESSOS Biot-Savart pullback, or XLA temporaries.
2. **Reuse quadrature plans across optimizer iterations.** virtual-casing-jax 0.0.5 ships
   "reusable quadrature plans" (vmex #123 already requires the release); audit
   `vmex/core/virtual_casing.py` + `problem.py:650` so plan/setup construction happens once per
   stage, never per evaluation (grep for per-call `VirtualCasingJAX.setup`).
3. **Chunk the kernel.** Target-point chunking via `solvax.chunk_map`/`auto_chunk_size` inside
   `plasma_field_on_boundary` and the bnormal/pressure-balance residuals so the (src x trg)
   tableau never materializes whole; same for the exterior `VmecExtender` batched queries.
4. **Adjoint-not-autodiff for the VC map (in virtual_casing_jax, own PR).** The virtual-casing
   integral operator is linear in its surface densities: its VJP is the transposed kernel applied
   to the cotangent — implement as `jax.custom_vjp` using the same chunked kernel (and the same
   quadrature plan) instead of letting JAX differentiate through plan assembly and singular-
   quadrature bookkeeping. This is the structural memory fix: forward-sized memory in the
   backward pass, no stored tableau. Certify against the existing FD tests
   (`tests/test_virtual_casing_physics.py`, rtol 1e-4..3e-4) and add a peak-RSS regression test.
5. **Precision policy.** Optional float32 kernel evaluation with float64 accumulation for the
   smooth far-field part (digits-controlled), float64 near-singular part; gate behind the
   existing `digits` knob and certify against the f64 kernel at the configured digits.
6. **Coil-side scaling.** The ESSOS Biot-Savart pullback over many coils/dofs: batch over coils
   with `chunk_map`, verify ESSOS's segment count enters linearly not quadratically, and recycle
   the boundary-quadrature phase tables across coils (coordinate with ESSOS #58 follow-up).
7. Acceptance: value+grad at max_mode=6, 16 coils, 128 curve dofs runs in < 8 GB and the
   gradient certificate stays green; memory scaling documented in the benchmark matrix (P8.1).

## Phase 12 — Minimum-|iota| objective as the default iota floor  [DONE]

Physics: with finite beta the bootstrap/driven current can carry the transform, so a mean-iota
target is satisfiable with tiny vacuum (shaping) iota — observed as the finite-beta single-stage
stall with small vacuum iota. We want most of iota from shaping. A floor on the *minimum* of
|iota(s)| over the profile pushes the whole profile up, not just its average, and (used in the
vacuum/coil-only stages and finite-beta stages alike) forces shaping transform rather than
current-carried transform.

1. **Core objective** (`vmex/core/statephysics.py`, next to `mean_iota:348`):
   `def min_abs_iota(state, rt): iotas = _iotas_half(state, rt); return jnp.min(jnp.abs(iotas[1:]))`
   — same half-mesh convention, axis excluded. Optionally add
   `soft_min_abs_iota(state, rt, tau=0.02)` (`-tau*logsumexp(-|iota|/tau)`) for a smooth min if
   least-squares progress near ties demands it; hard min is the default. Export both through
   `vmex/core/optimize.py` imports + `__all__` and document in `docs/reference/objectives.rst`
   (wout twin: `min(|wout.iotas[1:]|)` for the `jac=None` lane, mirroring `mean_iota`'s pair).
2. **Floor hinge convention** used by every script:
   `iota_floor = lambda state, rt: jnp.maximum(IOTA_FLOOR - opt.min_abs_iota(state, rt), 0.0)`
   (no `jnp.abs` wrapper needed — `min_abs_iota` is already sign-free). Keep one comment line:
   `# mean-iota alternative: opt.mean_iota targets the profile average instead of its minimum.`
3. **Rollout to every optimization script** (replace the 9 existing
   `IOTA_FLOOR - jnp.abs(opt.mean_iota(...))` hinges and the `(opt.mean_iota, IOTA_TARGET, w)`
   tuples where a floor is intended): `examples/optimization/{QA,QH,QP,QI}_optimization*.py`
   (incl. `_scipy`, `_global`, `_bootstrap`, `_DMerc_vacuum`, maxJ continuations),
   `examples/optimization/stellarator_asymmetry/*.py` (8 files),
   `examples/optimization/single_stage_*.py` (fixed and free-boundary, vacuum and finite beta).
   Scripts that genuinely want a target (not a floor) keep `mean_iota` with the comment.
4. **Tests**: unit (analytic profile: min vs mean differ, sign-flip invariance, axis exclusion);
   gradient vs FD through the implicit lane (pattern of `test_optimize_traceable_qs`); one
   integration assertion in the nightly example smokes that final `min|iota| >= IOTA_FLOOR - eps`
   for the QA vacuum example.
5. **Finite-beta shaping check** (the actual physics gate): in the finite-beta single-stage
   example, log both total `min|iota|` and the vacuum-field iota proxy (re-solve the final
   boundary at `pres_scale=0`/`curtor=0` in the wout postprocess step) and assert the vacuum
   fraction exceeds a documented threshold (e.g. >= 70%). This is what "iota from the
   stellarator, not from current" means operationally, and it becomes a regression test.

## Phase 13 — Single-stage example matrix: QA and QI, vacuum and finite beta

Deliver four verified single-stage examples (fixed-boundary lane; the free-boundary pair from
Phase 4 mirrors them): `single_stage_optimization.py` (QA vacuum — exists),
`single_stage_optimization_finite_beta.py` (QA — exists, unstall via P12 + P11),
`single_stage_QI_optimization.py` (new), `single_stage_QI_optimization_finite_beta.py` (new).

1. QI variants use `ConstructedQIResidual` + the P12 iota floor + mirror/elongation hinges
   (reuse the recipe from `examples/optimization/QI_optimization.py`), coils via ESSOS exactly
   as the QA single-stage does.
2. All four adopt: P12 min-|iota| floor, P1 flushed per-nfev progress, results into `results/`,
   `VMEX_EXAMPLES_CI=1` smoke mode, and a descent assertion in the nightly lane
   (`tests/test_examples.py` entries — executed, not text-grepped).
3. "Make sure it works" = each runs end-to-end in full mode on this Mac within a documented
   budget (record wall time in the example header), descends, and the finite-beta pair passes
   the P12.5 vacuum-iota-fraction check.

## Phase 14 — L_gradB and L_gradgradB metrics (Kappel)

The magnetic gradient scale length L_gradB = sqrt(2) |B| / ||grad B||_F (Kappel, Landreman,
Dudt, PPCF 66 025018 (2024), arXiv:2309.11342 — "the magnetic gradient scale length explains
why certain plasmas require close external magnetic coils"; implemented in DESC as the
`"L_grad(B)"` compute quantity in `desc/compute/_metric.py`; simsopt-side scripts in John
Kappel's work and in github.com/rogeriojorge repos, e.g. the single-stage/omnigenity
optimization scripts — check `single_stage_optimization` and QI/omnigenity repos for the
objective wiring pattern). vmex already has the wout lane `opt.l_grad_b` (`optimize.py:702`)
and traceable `l_grad_b_state` (`statephysics.py`), both symmetric-only.

1. **Convention lock + oracle.** Match DESC's `L_grad(B)` definition exactly (Frobenius norm of
   the full Cartesian grad B tensor, sqrt(2) normalization); add a parity test vs DESC on a
   shared wout (same pattern as `test_matches_desc_bounce1d_when_available`) and vs the
   existing vmex implementation on symmetric cases.
2. **LASYM support** for `_lgradb_state_tables` / `l_grad_b` — the Phase 5b.3 item; the wout
   arrays (`bsupumns`, `bsupvmns`, `rmns`, `zmnc`) already exist, plumbing only.
3. **L_gradgradB (new).** Second-order scale length L_gradgradB = sqrt(2 |B| / ||grad grad B||_F)
   (the k=2 member of the L_grad^k B family; verify the exact normalization against DESC master
   and the Kappel paper appendix before freezing the name). Implementation: extend the
   `_lgradb_grid` tables with second radial/angular derivatives of (R, Z, B^u, B^v) — the
   Cartesian hessian assembly mirrors `extender.py`'s interior `gradgradB` (which already
   exists for point queries); a surface-grid version over the optimization surfaces is what's
   new. Traceable, jit/vmap-clean, with FD-vs-JVP tests and min-over-surface + softmin reducers.
4. **Objectives + example.** Export `l_grad_b` / `l_grad_grad_b` state objectives (min-over-
   surfaces scalar and per-surface residual forms); add to `examples/optimization/
   QA_optimization.py` as commented-out objective tuples with one-line guidance
   (`# (opt.l_grad_b, L_GRADB_TARGET, w)  # coil-simplicity proxy, Kappel PPCF 2024`), and use
   them for real in one coil-aware example once P11 lands (their whole point is coil distance).
5. **Performance**: both metrics are pointwise algebra on existing field tables — target < 0.1 s
   overhead per evaluation at example resolutions; no new solves.

- 2026-08-18 rogeriojorge: initial plan from the two assessment/profiling sessions on
  `rj/vmec-extender-field` (measured baselines table above; stall root-caused to pathological
  Jacobian executions P1.a + `_block_lane` recompile churn P1.b; `jax_explain_cache_misses`
  crash P1.6; FD-certificate recipe P3b from the ftol/cold-probe scan; LASYM/eps_eff/NEO/docs
  audits distilled into P5-P7, P10). Added P11-P14 (virtual-casing memory, min-|iota| floor,
  QA/QI single-stage matrix, Kappel L_gradB/L_gradgradB). Plan committed as its own PR; all
  implementation PRs branch from main after PR #123 merges (P0).
- 2026-08-18 rogeriojorge: P1.a quantified with the completed instrumented stage
  (`profile_stall.py`): jac #1-2 = 1.8-3.9 s, every later Jacobian ~2000-2240 s (~42 s/dof
  column) with residuals steady at 3.5 s — the degradation is systematic once x leaves the
  reference state, so the amortized factor-once Jacobian path is priority one of Phase 1.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P0 [DONE except merge] — ruff E701/F541, manifest entry for
  tests/test_neoclassical.py, trial-pressure test + docs pointer, JAX autodiff URL, scipy>=1.15
  pin. Two further blockers surfaced only once ruff stopped short-circuiting the job: the quality
  lane installs mypy unpinned (2.3.1) and rejects two inferred lambdas, so
  `plotting._epsilon_effective_summary` and `extender._stored_flux_quantity` now use named
  functions. Quality and docs-linkcheck jobs are green; PR #123 is ready to merge. Dev-tool
  version pinning is unresolved and belongs in P9/P10 (an unpinned major broke a gate silently).
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P12 [DONE] — `min_abs_iota` / `soft_min_abs_iota` in statephysics,
  exported through optimize, rolled out as the default floor across 20 optimization examples
  (9 existing hinges converted, 11 mean-iota targets turned into floors, reporters now print
  min |iota|), docs updated, tests added (wout-convention parity, reducer separation and
  sign-freedom, JVP-vs-FD). Design change from the plan text: the softmin uses a
  softmax-weighted mean, not log-sum-exp — the latter sits `tau log(ns)` *below* the true
  minimum (measured -0.068 where the minimum was 1e-12), which is wrong for a non-negative
  floor. P12.5 (vacuum-iota-fraction check in the finite-beta examples) is NOT done.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1 [PARTIAL] — items 1, 3 and 6 landed: the five `emit=print`
  defaults now flush, `monitoring` flushes its reporter/table rows, `OptimizationMonitor`
  splits the residual SciPy already hands its callback instead of re-solving the equilibrium
  per accepted iterate, and `FunctionProblem` gained `evaluation_progress` (+ `report_interval`)
  so residual and Jacobian evaluations run under the existing elapsed-time heartbeat; enabled
  in 20 examples. P1.a (the real stall) is still open and now better measured: a full
  instrumented LASYM QA stage shows jac #1-2 at 1.8-3.9 s and every later Jacobian at
  2000-2240 s with residuals steady at 3.5 s. Mechanism located: `jacobian_rows_block`
  (optimize.py:2693) factors the raw block-tridiagonal system once and then runs a
  warm-started certifying GMRES per column via `_implicit_evolved_tangent_multi_rhs`
  (implicit.py:1944-1965) against `cfg.adjoint_tol`; that certifier is the suspect, since the
  factorization stops being a good preconditioner as the iterate moves. The decisive experiment
  (same iterate, `adjoint_tol` 1e-6/1e-4 and `implicit_jacobian_method="forward_gmres"`) is
  scripted in the session scratchpad as `jac_probe.py` and was still running at hand-off — run
  it first. Note the certifier's iteration counts cannot be read with a host-side spy (they are
  traced); expose them through the existing `LinearResponseReport` instead.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P2 [PARTIAL] — the cache bound now scales with the filesystem
  (`min(20 GiB, max(2 GiB, 10% free))`, floor on unreadable paths) instead of a fixed 1 GiB that
  both machine-fingerprint directories sat pegged at, and `--doctor` prints the directory, its
  occupancy and the bound, flagging a cache within 5% of its cap. But the measurement corrects
  this phase's premise: with a *fresh* cache directory, one `compile_residual_and_jacobian`
  wrote only **2 entries / 768 KB** and the second process was no faster. The config is applied
  correctly (verified: cache dir, enable flag, `min_compile_time_secs=1.0`, new bound), so
  eviction was never the main story — almost nothing in this workload is cacheable XLA
  compilation above the 1 s floor. The remaining "compile" wall is sub-second XLA modules
  (filtered by `jax_persistent_cache_min_compile_time_secs=1.0`) plus Python-side tracing and
  jaxpr->MLIR lowering, which the persistent cache cannot serve at all. Next steps for this
  phase, in order: (1) re-measure on a quiet machine with `jax_log_compiles` captured from
  *stdout* (the logging handler writes there, not stderr) and split total vs summed XLA vs
  summed lowering; (2) try `VMEX_CACHE_MIN_COMPILE_TIME_SECS=0.1` and see whether entry count
  and second-run time move; (3) if lowering dominates, the lever is graph size/count in
  `_least_squares_implicit`, not the cache. Raising the bound stays correct regardless.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P0 follow-up — the changed-line coverage gate is still red at **78%**
  and this is NOT what the plan assumed. Adding `tests/test_neoclassical.py` to the manifest does
  not help, because the coverage job combines artifacts only from the `fast`, `physics-*` and
  `device` jobs, and those run curated `selectors` (`pr-physics-core`, `pr-implicit-response`,
  ...) plus the `pr-fast` lane — the `pr-parity-*` lanes never execute on a pull request. Most of
  PR #123's new physics is reachable only from `full`-marked or optional-dependency tests, so it
  contributes zero coverage: `boozer_tables.py 0%`, `omnigenity.py 4.8%`, `maxj.py 18%`,
  `neoclassical.py 27.5%`, `freeboundary_implicit.py 57.2%`, `optimize.py 78.7%` (456 changed
  lines missing). The gate was already failing this way before this session's commits. Two ways
  forward, both Phase 9 work rather than Phase 0: add fast unit tests for those lines, or add the
  relevant test ids to the CI selectors (done for the two new `min_abs_iota` certificates, which
  had the same problem — they lived in `pr-parity-d` and never ran on PRs). Until one of those
  lands, #123 merges only with an explicit exception.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a methodology note — do NOT diagnose this by timing the Jacobian
  to completion; each data point costs ~35 min and a four-way comparison runs for hours. Bound
  the work instead. An uncertified column falls back to the block-factorization solution rather
  than raising (`_implicit_evolved_tangent_multi_rhs` masks on `report.converged`), so capping
  `adjoint_maxiter` through the public `make_problem` knob is safe and makes the cost bounded by
  construction. Then the *signature* is what to read, not the wall time: at a well-conditioned
  iterate the Jacobian time is flat in the cap because the certifier converges in a couple of
  matvecs, and where it is grinding the time grows roughly linearly with the cap. Run it on a
  deliberately small deck (ns=11, mpol=4, max_mode=1, ndof=16) — the question is how convergence
  degrades with the iterate, not how cost scales with resolution. Script:
  `jac_bounded.py` in the session scratchpad. Two dead ends recorded so nobody repeats them: a
  host-side spy on `_linear_response_report` cannot read the iteration counts (they are traced
  inside jit — expose them through `LinearResponseReport` instead), and passing `jac_solver=` to
  `from_tuples` raises (the public knob is `implicit_jacobian_method`, values
  auto/block_tridiagonal/forward_gmres/reverse_adjoint).
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P8 groundwork — the office box (`ssh office`, pop-os, 2x RTX A4000
  16 GB, 36 cores, 62 GB RAM) now has the PR branch checked out at ~/local/vmex and imports it
  cleanly on CUDA. Note the version skew against this laptop: office runs jax 0.6.2, laptop jax
  0.9.2, both with solvax 0.13.0 — any CPU/GPU comparison has to say which jax produced it. First
  matrix rows (fixed-boundary solve, problem build, compile, residual, Jacobian; symmetric and
  LASYM at ns=31/mpol=5) are scripted at /tmp/gpu_bench.py on that host and write
  /tmp/bench_cpu.json and /tmp/bench_gpu.json.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a measured, and one earlier conclusion RETRACTED. The shipped
  Jacobian lanes now carry their certifier statistics out with the rows (`_certifier_summary` /
  `_record_certifier` in optimize.py; `holder["jac_certifier_iterations"]`,
  `["jac_certifier_unconverged"]`, `["jac_certifier_worst"]`), which turns this from a
  multi-hour timing hunt into one observable run. First numbers, LASYM QA vs the symmetric case
  of the same shape: **542 certifier iterations vs 23**, zero uncertified columns in both. So
  the certifier genuinely works much harder on the asymmetric problem.
  BUT the tolerance sweep at that same iterate shows the iteration count is NOT the wall-time
  driver there: adjoint_tol 1e-6/1e-5/1e-4/1e-3 gives iterations 542/66/0/0 while the Jacobian
  takes 85.4/103.8/93.8/68.6 s — flat inside compile noise, since each build recompiles. The
  accuracy price of relaxing is negligible and plateaus immediately (relative Jacobian
  difference 3.07e-5 at 1e-5, 3.24e-5 at 1e-4 and 1e-3). Do not conclude "the certifier is the
  stall" from the iteration count alone — that was my error; the count and the cost have to be
  measured separately. `jac_split.py` (two calls in one process, so the second carries no
  compilation) isolates compile from the block assembly/factorization and the certifier, and the
  instrumented run of the real stalling iterate (`jac_real.py`, jac #2 is the 2000 s one) will
  say whether the count explodes there. Both were in flight at hand-off. If the warm cost at
  1e-6 turns out to dwarf the warm cost at 1e-4, a separate looser Jacobian-certification
  tolerance is the fix and 1e-4 is defensible on the measured accuracy. If it does not, the time
  is in `_raw_block_system`'s probe assembly and factorization, and the Schur/preconditioner
  work of Phase 3 is the lever instead.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a SOLVED, with the full chain measured. The instrumented run of the
  real stalling stage (LASYM QA, ns=21, mpol=5, 48 dofs) reads:
  `jac #1 77 s, certifier iters=542, unconverged=0` then
  `jac #2 3456 s, certifier iters=9000, unconverged=47`. So at the second accepted iterate the
  per-column certifier runs to its ceiling (adjoint_maxiter 300 x 30 restarts) and still fails
  on 47 of 48 columns; those come back NaN, the whole Jacobian is discarded for the previous
  one, and the stage spends 58 minutes making no progress with nothing on screen. That is the
  stall, end to end.
  Fix shipped: `ImplicitConfig.jacobian_adjoint_tol` (default 1e-4), applied by the two Jacobian
  lanes through a `jac_cfg = dataclasses.replace(cfg, adjoint_tol=cfg.jacobian_adjoint_tol)`;
  uncertified columns now raise a RuntimeWarning naming the knob. Measured at the seed iterate,
  warm (compile excluded by calling twice in one process): **13.3 s -> 2.8 s, certifier 542 -> 0
  iterations, relative Jacobian change 3.2e-5**. The rationale is that the two tolerances have
  different consumers — a scalar gradient feeds quasi-Newton curvature accumulation, a
  least-squares Jacobian only points a trust-region step.
  IMPORTANT scoping lesson: relaxing the tolerance inside the shared
  `_implicit_evolved_tangent_multi_rhs` helper broke
  `test_block_response_forward_transpose_and_fd` (a genuine transpose/FD identity at rtol 2e-8,
  measured error 5.2e-5). The helper keeps `adjoint_tol` for its public callers; only the
  Jacobian lanes relax. Do not push the relaxation down into the helper.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P8 warning about the office box — do NOT trust remote numbers without
  pinning the import. `~/local/vmex` is NOT what `import vmex` resolves to there: an editable
  install points at a second checkout, `/home/rjorge/vmex_profile/vmex`, and a script invoked as
  `python3 /tmp/bench.py` puts `/tmp` (not the cwd) on `sys.path[0]`, so the stale tree wins.
  Two rounds of benchmark numbers were silently produced from it, including a bogus
  `NotImplementedError: QuasisymmetryRatioResidual traceable evaluation supports lasym = False
  only` that exists in no current source, and a 575 s symmetric Jacobian. Always run remote work
  as `cd <checkout> && PYTHONPATH=<checkout> python3 ...` and assert `vmex.__file__` in the
  output. Clearing `__pycache__` does not help — it was never the cache.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a OPEN DECISION for whoever picks this up. The
  `jacobian_adjoint_tol = 1e-4` default is committed and the speedup is real and large — at the
  degraded iterate the warm Jacobian goes 395 s -> 28 s (certifier 9000 iterations and 47/48
  columns uncertified, versus 207 iterations and all certified). But two things must be settled
  before calling it finished:
  (1) `tests/test_optimize.py::test_least_squares_implicit_jac_solver_block` now FAILS. It pins
  the block lane against the per-dof GMRES lane at `rtol=1e-6`, and that guarantee genuinely
  weakens when both lanes certify to 1e-4 (each is within 1e-4 of exact, so they may differ by
  2e-4). This is the trade-off surfacing honestly, not a flaky test. Do NOT relax the assertion
  just to make it green — decide the policy first, then update the test AND its docstring to
  state the new contract.
  (2) The loose-vs-tight difference is 3.2e-5 at a clean iterate but 1.4e-1 at the degraded one.
  That large number is almost certainly comparing against a broken reference: at that iterate the
  tight solve fails its certificate, returns NaN columns, and the caller falls back to the
  previous Jacobian — so "tight" there is not a Jacobian at all. `jac_accuracy.py` in the session
  scratchpad settles it by comparing BOTH against a central finite-difference column and printing
  the uncertified/NaN counts for each; it was still running at hand-off. If loose matches FD and
  tight does not, the default is not merely faster but more correct, and the block-vs-GMRES test
  should be re-pinned at the Jacobian tolerance. If loose does NOT match FD, reconsider: keep the
  tight default and make the fix adaptive instead (start tight, relax only when the certifier
  reports uncertified columns), which the new `holder["jac_certifier_unconverged"]` counter makes
  straightforward.
  Everything else in Phase 1 (flush, heartbeat, monitor double-solve, examples) is done and green.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a — a central finite difference is NOT a usable arbiter for this
  Jacobian, do not spend time on it. Measured: at the degraded iterate, column 0 against a
  central FD came out 8.3e-1 relative for the tight Jacobian and 2.6e0 for the loose one. Both
  being of order one says the FD is wrong, not the Jacobians: each probe re-solves the
  equilibrium through the perturbation warm start, so the difference is dominated by solver
  endpoint noise rather than by the derivative (the same endpoint-noise effect already
  documented for the coupled free-boundary certificate in P3b). Same run also showed the tight
  solve reaching 9000 iterations with 9 uncertified columns and taking a derivative fallback,
  while 1e-4 certified everything in 207 iterations — i.e. at that iterate the tight result is
  the one that is not trustworthy. The arbiter that does work is a tight solve given enough
  iteration budget to actually certify every column (`jac_arbiter.py`: tol=1e-8,
  adjoint_maxiter=4000, and it checks `unconverged == 0 and derivative_fallbacks == 0` before
  accepting itself as ground truth), then comparing 1e-6/1e-4/1e-3 against it. That was running
  at hand-off; its result decides the open question above.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P9/P0 changed-line coverage gate **78% -> 96%** (464 -> 84 missing of
  2144 changed lines), merged. The cheap wins dominated exactly as hoped: most of it came from
  running modules the pull-request lanes never selected (`test_boozer_tables`, `test_maxj`,
  `test_optimize_traceable_qs`, `test_virtual_casing_api` into `pr-physics-field`; `test_doctor`
  and `test_neoclassical` into `pr-fast`), not from new tests. Zero `full` markers were demoted —
  none of the candidates ran in under 20 s. One genuinely new certificate was worth its cost: a
  percent-level cross-check of the boundary-Schur adjoint against the certified coupled GCROT
  adjoint on a shared converged root (202 s, the two gradients agree to 0.53%), which is the
  first fast-lane coverage of that path; note it needs `adjoint_tol=1e-5`, because at 1e-9 the
  Schur lane's own certification does not converge within 3017 Krylov iterations. Estimated CI
  wall goes ~17.5 -> ~22 min, inside the 30-minute budget. When merging, the per-node maximum-J
  entries in `pr-physics-core` were dropped: the whole module now runs in `pr-physics-field`, so
  listing individual ids only duplicated it.
  Two DEAD-CODE findings for Phase 10, both confirmed unreachable rather than merely untested:
  `implicit.py` `_raw_block_apply`'s `factors is None` guard and its iterative-refinement loop
  (`refinements` is never passed non-zero anywhere in the tree), and `omnigenity.py:328,330-331`
  (the in-body LASYM mirror branch, unreachable because `boozer_bmnc_state` returns early through
  `_boozer_lasym_state` for asymmetric states — the maximum-J agent independently found the same
  thing). Delete both rather than write tests for them.
  Of the 84 lines still missing, the honest reasons are recorded: `optimize.py` closures that
  need a solve-backed `VmecProblem`, a `freeboundary_implicit.py` m=1 edge-pairing branch
  unreachable on the only free-boundary deck available (DIII-D, `ntor=0`), extender parameter-VJP
  fallbacks, `FFMpegWriter`, and the successful `import neo_jax` line.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1 [DONE]. The open decision is closed by measurement, and the
  earlier worry about it was based on two of my own mistakes, both now fixed.
  Final sweep at the LASYM QA iterate (warm, compile excluded by calling twice in one process),
  `jacobian_adjoint_tol` against a 1e-7 reference:

  | tol | warm jac | certifier iters | uncertified | relative vs 1e-7 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1e-7 | 23.1 s | 962 | 0 | reference |
  | 1e-6 (old behaviour) | 6.6 s | 542 | 0 | 1.8e-5 |
  | **1e-4 (new default)** | **1.2 s** | **0** | 0 | **4.4e-5** |
  | 1e-3 | 1.2 s | 0 | 0 | 4.4e-5 |

  So the default is 19x faster than a 1e-7 Jacobian and 5.5x faster than the old 1e-6 one, for
  4.4e-5 relative error — and the error *plateaus* there, because at 1e-4 the certifier accepts
  the block backsolve unchanged (0 iterations) and 1e-3 buys nothing further. At the degraded
  iterate the same change is the difference between converging in 207 iterations and running to
  9000 with 47 of 48 columns uncertified over 58 minutes.
  MISTAKE 1 (retracted): I believed the failing
  `test_least_squares_implicit_jac_solver_block` showed the tolerance legitimately weakening
  block-vs-GMRES agreement, and nearly relaxed its assertion. Measured in that test's own case
  the two lanes agree to **1.1e-16**. The failure was unrelated.
  MISTAKE 2 (the real bug, fixed): carrying the tolerance as
  `dataclasses.replace(cfg, adjoint_tol=...)` gave the Jacobian lanes a second config identity,
  which misses every cache keyed on the original and rebuilt the runtime *inside* the traced
  Jacobian — a TracerArrayConversionError out of `setup.radial_grids`, and the CI
  implicit-response lane. A tolerance is a number: it is now threaded as `rtol=` through
  `_adjoint_solve`, `_adjoint_acceptance`, and the multi-RHS certifier. General lesson for this
  codebase: never manufacture a new `ImplicitConfig` on a traced path.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P8 first verified remote row (office box, 36-core CPU, jax 0.6.2,
  import asserted as /home/rjorge/local/vmex): symmetric ns=31/mpol=5/max_mode=2, solve 2.9 s,
  build 56.7 s, compile 754.5 s, residual 0.52 s, **Jacobian 516.2 s**. That checkout predates
  the Jacobian-tolerance fix, so it is a pre-fix baseline — but a Jacobian that costs ~2-10 s on
  an Apple laptop costing ~500 s on a 36-core Linux box is a real finding for the performance
  program, and the first thing to re-measure there after the fix lands. Compile at 754 s on that
  machine also dwarfs the laptop's ~40 s.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P10 partial — the two unreachable paths found during the coverage work
  are deleted (`58166f57`): `_raw_block_apply`'s iterative-refinement loop, whose `refinements`
  count no caller has ever passed, and the poloidal-mirror branch for asymmetric states in
  `boozer_bmnc_state`, unreachable because those states return through `_boozer_lasym_state`
  about thirty lines earlier. Note the distinction that matters when clearing the rest of the
  Phase 10 list: an unused *feature* is dead and goes, but a *precondition guard* is not the same
  thing even when uncovered. `_raw_block_apply`'s `factors is None` raise states a real contract
  for systems built with `factor=False`, so it stays and now has a three-line test rather than
  being deleted for the coverage number. Do not treat "uncovered" as a synonym for "dead" when
  working the remaining items.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P6.8 plot fix done (`74cafb91`) — the eps_eff panel now picks its
  scale from the data. Measured on `wout_QA_optimized.nc`: the profile spans 1.64e-3 to 4.37e-3,
  a factor of 2.67, i.e. well under one decade, which is the normal case for an *optimized*
  configuration. Matplotlib's log autoscale snapped that to a single decade tick, flattening the
  curve against a limit and hiding the radial minimum — precisely what the panel is read for.
  The rule is now: keep the logarithm only when the profile actually spans a decade or more,
  otherwise linear with scientific tick labels, and pad the limits by 8% of the range so the
  extrema sit inside. After the change the same case gives 7 tick labels with the minimum
  comfortably inside the axis. Both branches are pinned by tests (the pre-existing test uses a
  3-decade `geomspace` and still asserts log; the new one uses a 2.7x span and asserts linear,
  the minimum inside the limits, and at least four tick labels).
  Still open in this area: more surfaces in the summary panel, which is gated on the eps_eff lane
  being fast (P6), not on plotting.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P8 first complete verified CPU rows, office box (36-core, jax 0.6.2,
  import asserted, single process, ns=31/mpol=5/max_mode=2, checkout at 1edffddc so PRE the
  Jacobian-tolerance fix):

  | case | ndof | solve | build | compile | residual | Jacobian |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | symmetric | 24 | 2.9 s | 56.7 s | 754.5 s | 0.52 s | 516.2 s |
  | LASYM | 48 | 7.6 s | 32.5 s | 1055.9 s | 0.69 s | 869.4 s |

  Two readings. (1) The LASYM/symmetric Jacobian ratio is **1.68x**, which independently
  reproduces the 1.8x per-nfev ratio measured on the laptop — the asymmetric cost model holds
  across machines, so LASYM is genuinely not the problem. (2) The absolute numbers are the
  problem: the same Jacobian takes 1.8 s (symmetric) and 9.8 s (LASYM) on an Apple laptop and
  516 s / 869 s here, and compile is 754-1056 s against roughly 40 s. That is a 90-280x machine
  gap on identical code, and it is what a cluster user would actually experience.
  Hypotheses, cheapest first: **jax 0.6.2 versus 0.9.2** (three minor versions of XLA:CPU work,
  and the laptop is the newer one — most likely explanation, test by upgrading jax on that host
  and re-measuring, but that changes someone's environment so ask first); thread oversubscription
  on 36 cores for a memory-bound blocked solve (probe running now under `taskset -c 0-7`, which
  is non-invasive); and Apple Silicon's unified memory favouring this access pattern. Settle
  which before drawing any CPU-vs-GPU conclusion from that machine, and re-measure after the
  Jacobian-tolerance fix propagates there.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P5d PR 1 opened — **PrincetonUniversity/STELLOPT#501**, from the new
  fork `rogeriojorge/STELLOPT`, branch `fix/neo-boozmn-bmns-index`, one line. Verified against
  *current* upstream `develop` (1065c80b) rather than the local checkout, which is ~2280 commits
  behind: the bug is live there. `bmns(i,i)` -> `bmns(i,k)` in
  `NEO/Sources/read_booz_in.f90`; the three neighbouring assignments and the in-memory
  equivalent at `STELLOPTV2/Sources/General/stellopt_neo.f90` all use `(i,k)`, so only the
  standalone reader is affected. Practical consequence for us: until this merges, generate LASYM
  effective-ripple references either from a locally patched `xneo` or through the STELLOPT
  optimizer path, never from stock standalone `xneo` (P5c validation, P6 parity ladder).
  PR 2 (the `neo_dealloc.f90` mismatches, `DEALLOCATE(pixn)` guarded on `pixm` and
  `DEALLOCATE(i_n)` guarded on `i_m`, plus the LASYM arrays never being freed) is still to open;
  keep it separate as planned.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P5d PR 2 opened — **PrincetonUniversity/STELLOPT#502**, branch
  `fix/neo-dealloc-mismatched-arrays`, also verified against current upstream. Frees `pixm` and
  `i_m` (whose guards previously freed `pixn`/`i_n` instead) and adds the four LASYM spectra
  `rmns/zmnc/lmnc/bmns`, which `READ_BOOZ_IN` allocates but nothing releases. Both leak once per
  `neo_dealloc`, which compounds in an optimization loop that reinitializes NEO each iteration.
  P5d is now complete: both upstream PRs are open and Phase 5 can proceed on the NEO_JAX side.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P0 CI is **fully green** on PR #123 — all thirteen jobs including
  `Changed executable lines (>= 95%)` and the PR gate, plus Docs linkcheck. The branch arrived
  red (ruff, manifest, trial-pressure test, dead link, changed-line coverage at 78%) and is now
  clean. `MERGEABLE / BLOCKED` remains only because the PR still wants its review approval; the
  merge itself is deliberately left to a human.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P8 — thread oversubscription is RULED OUT as the explanation for the
  office box's slow Jacobian. Same symmetric case pinned to 8 cores with `taskset -c 0-7`:
  Jacobian 469.1 s and compile 711.5 s, against 516.2 s and 754.5 s on all 36 — a 9% improvement,
  i.e. noise on this scale, not the 90-280x factor. The LASYM row agrees: 819.3 s on 8 cores
  against 869.4 s on 36, again ~6%. Both cases, both directions, same answer. Restricting cores if anything helps slightly,
  which is the opposite of a thread-thrashing signature. That leaves **jax 0.6.2 versus 0.9.2**
  as the standing hypothesis (and the laptop, which is 90-280x faster here, is the one on the
  newer JAX). Next step is to upgrade jax on that host and re-measure — it changes someone's
  environment, so ask first. If the version turns out not to explain it, profile XLA:CPU on that
  host directly rather than guessing at a third hypothesis.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: **P1.a REOPENED — the tolerance fix does not solve the stall.** I
  called it done on per-Jacobian microbenchmarks; the end-to-end stage says otherwise, and the
  end-to-end number is the one that matters. Both runs are the same LASYM QA stage, 20 nfev:

  | Jacobian | before | after `jacobian_adjoint_tol=1e-4` |
  |---|---|---|
  | #1 | 3.94 s | 1.48 s |
  | #2 | 1.75 s | 1.49 s |
  | #3 | 3848 s | 1557 s |
  | #4 | 1995 s | 1899 s |
  | #5 | 2237 s | 2000 s |
  | #6 | 2024 s | 2038 s |

  The pre-fix stage completed in **54,940 s (15.3 hours)** for 20 nfev, with residuals steady at
  3.5 s — so about 99.9% of it was the certifier. The tolerance change is a real ~2.5x win at
  iterates where the certifier already converges, and buys nothing on the plateau. Config was
  verified live (`cfg.jacobian_adjoint_tol = 0.0001`), so this is not a wiring problem.
  What the plateau actually is: ~2000 s = the 9000-iteration ceiling
  (`adjoint_maxiter` 300 x `adjoint_restart` 30) at ~0.22 s per iteration. Beyond iterate ~3 the
  no-pivot block-Thomas factorization stops being a good preconditioner and **no tolerance in a
  sane range is reachable** — the Schur lane's own comment already says a globally pivoted sparse
  LU is materially more accurate than block-Thomas near the axis, which is the same observation
  from the other side. Then the uncertified columns were NaN-ed, the caller fell back to the
  *previous* Jacobian, and the whole 2000 s was discarded: work spent and then wasted.
  Fix now under measurement: bound the certifier (`jacobian_adjoint_maxiter`, default 10 restarts
  = 300 Krylov iterations) and **keep its output instead of NaN-ing it**. GMRES starts from the
  direct block solve and decreases the residual monotonically, so a bounded corrector is at least
  as good as that solve however far it got — strictly better than reverting to a stale Jacobian.
  If that lands the stage in minutes, P1.a closes; if the resulting Jacobian is too inaccurate to
  optimize with, the real fix is Phase 3's pivoted factorization / preconditioner, and the
  tolerance and budget knobs are only damage control.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a — bounding the certifier and keeping its answer takes the same
  20-nfev LASYM QA stage from **54,940 s to 560.9 s, a 98x speedup**. Per Jacobian on the
  plateau: 2038 s -> 44.6 s. The change is two things together, and both are needed:
  `jacobian_adjoint_maxiter` (10 restarts = 300 Krylov iterations), and *not* NaN-ing the
  columns that miss tolerance. GMRES warm-starts from the direct block solve and decreases the
  residual monotonically, so its bounded output is at least as good as that solve; NaN-ing it
  made the caller fall back to the previous Jacobian, so the 2000 s was spent and then thrown
  away.
  The cost is real and must be stated: 40-47 of 48 columns finish uncertified, and after 20 nfev
  the stage reaches cost 3.088 where the exact-Jacobian run reached 2.625 (17.6% worse), with
  njev=13 against 20. So this is an approximate-Jacobian Gauss-Newton, not the same algorithm
  running faster. Whether it is the right default rests on whether it wins *per unit wall clock*
  — 98x more iterations per hour against ~18% worse progress per iteration — which is being
  measured rather than assumed.
  DIAGNOSIS for Phase 3, and it is the important part: that so many columns need large
  corrections contradicts the documented claim that the raw residual Jacobian is exactly block
  tridiagonal. If it were, the direct block solve would be near-exact and the certifier would
  converge in about one iteration, as it does at the first two iterates. It stops converging from
  iterate ~3 on, which matches `_host_boundary_schur_adjoint`'s own comment that a globally
  pivoted sparse LU is materially more accurate than no-pivot block-Thomas near the axis. So the
  principled fix is to route the Jacobian's bulk solve through the pivoted `SpluFactorization`
  the Schur lane already builds; the columns would then be fast *and* certified, and the budget
  knob would go back to being a safety net rather than the mechanism.
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a — the pivoted-factorization diagnosis I logged earlier is WRONG;
  do not implement it. Two measurements retire it and reframe the problem.
  **Budget sweep** at a degraded iterate: restart budget 10 / 30 / 100 costs 107 / 226 / 675 s,
  runs the full 300 / 900 / 3000 Krylov iterations, leaves exactly **40** columns uncertified in
  all three, and moves the Jacobian by **2.3e-8** between the smallest and largest. Tenfold work,
  no additional column certified, no change in the answer. That is stagnation, not slow
  convergence — and it makes `jacobian_adjoint_maxiter = 10` a measured default.
  **Band-versus-exact discriminator**, same direct block solve, residual against each operator:
  healthy iterate 3.958e-09 (band) / 3.955e-09 (exact); degraded iterate 3.002e-09 / 3.016e-09.
  So (a) the no-pivot block-Thomas factorization is accurate even where the certifier fails — a
  pivoted `SpluFactorization` would buy nothing — and (b) the raw Jacobian really is banded, the
  exact operator agreeing with the band one to nine digits. Both of my candidate causes are dead.
  What is left: the direct solve is already accurate to 3e-9, yet the corrector cannot certify it.
  The corrector runs on the *preconditioned* residual (`residual_fn`) while the block system
  solves the *raw* one; they share a solution but not a norm, so the certificate is being
  measured in a badly scaled space. The likely conclusion is that the columns were always
  accurate and only the certificate was failing — being confirmed against the independent
  per-dof forward-GMRES lane (`cross_lane.py`), which shares no solver machinery with the block
  path. If they agree, then the 98x speedup costs nothing in Jacobian quality and the real
  defect is the certificate measure, not the solver.
  Independently worth doing either way: the certifier still uses plain restarted GMRES, while
  `ImplicitConfig` documents (right above the knobs) that at high mode number restarted GMRES
  stalls where GCROT converges, which is exactly the stagnation measured here — and the
  reverse-adjoint lane already uses GCROT for that reason. `_adjoint_solve_gcrot` now accepts a
  tolerance, a bounded budget, and a non-enforcing mode, and it takes a `precond`, so the block
  inverse can precondition it rather than merely warm-start it (Phase 3's original proposal).
- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: P1.a final state for this pass. Scored by residual on the EXACT
  operator at a degraded iterate (random right-hand side): direct block solve 2.663e-09,
  warm-started corrector 2.663e-09, **corrector from zero 5.746e-01**, GCROT with the block
  inverse as preconditioner 4.356e-09. Three conclusions. (1) The corrector adds nothing to an
  already-accurate direct solve — it starts at the answer and stagnates there. (2) The
  `forward_gmres` lane, which starts from zero, leaves a **57% residual**: it is not solving the
  system when it stagnates, and before the NaN change an uncertified block Jacobian fell back to
  exactly that lane, so the old path could hand the optimizer a badly wrong Jacobian at the
  hardest iterates. That makes the bounded-certifier change a correctness fix, not only a speed
  one. (3) Preconditioned GCROT works but is unnecessary at 4.4e-9 against the direct solve's
  2.7e-9 — Phase 3's preconditioning proposal is sound but buys nothing here, so it is NOT
  implemented. `_adjoint_solve_gcrot` keeps its new `rtol`/`max_restarts`/`enforce` parameters,
  which are useful regardless.
  Certificate retargeted to the raw operator the columns are consumed through (commit
  `d7bd1776`): stage 561 s -> 440 s, and the first degraded Jacobian now certifies cleanly
  (`unconv` 40 -> 0). **But iterates 4+ still report 38-46 uncertified in the raw norm**, so for
  the REAL parameter tangents — as opposed to the random right-hand side probed above — the block
  solve genuinely is not accurate at those points. The Jacobian there is approximate, the ~18%
  worse stage cost (3.088 against 2.625) is real and attributable, and more Krylov work provably
  does not help (budget sweep: 10x work, 2.3e-8 change). OPEN: measure the raw residual for the
  actual tangents rather than a random vector, and retry preconditioned GCROT on those; the
  random-vector probe was misleading and is the reason this took three wrong turns.

## Phase 15 — Ecosystem ownership: stop reimplementing sibling packages

From the PR #123 review. VMEX has grown modules that duplicate what a uwplasma
sibling already owns or should own. Every one of these makes VMEX heavier and
splits the physics across two implementations that can drift. The rule: the
package that owns the physics owns the code; VMEX keeps only the thin adapter
its own scripts need.

1. **`virtual_casing.py` -> `virtual_casing_jax`.** Highest priority, because
   ESSOS already uses virtual_casing_jax for finite-beta coil optimization,
   other codes do too, and simsopt is expected to. Move the API and the
   functionality there — fast, differentiable, complete — and keep in VMEX only
   what VMEX-specific scripts need (state-to-surface-data adaptation, the
   `PlasmaVacuumInterface` convenience). Decide explicitly whether
   `virtual_casing.py` survives at all. Pairs with Phase 11 (its memory work
   should land in virtual_casing_jax, not here).
2. **`boozer_tables.py` -> `booz_xform_jax`.** A Boozer transform belongs to the
   Boozer package. Check whether anything in it is VMEX-specific before moving.
3. **`omnigenity.py`**: the traceable Boozer spectrum (`boozer_bmnc_state`,
   `_boozer_lasym_state`) is booz_xform_jax's job; the QI residuals are
   objectives and stay. Also resolve why `omnigenity.py` and `qi.py` are
   separate files with overlapping content — one of them should absorb the
   other.
4. **`neoclassical.py` -> `neo_jax`.** neo_jax should do more than legacy NEO:
   effective ripple straight from a wout, the diagnostics, fast, accurate, and
   differentiable. VMEX then calls it instead of adapting it. Supersedes the
   adapter-shaped part of Phase 6.
5. **`freeboundary_diff.py`**: delete. Already agreed; fix the one real caller
   (`tools/build_qi_sheet_mgrid.py`).
6. **`extender.py` reorganization.** It holds several things that are not the
   extender: the magnetic-field class, xyz/cylindrical coordinate handling,
   interior and exterior field evaluation. Proposal from the review: a
   `magnetic_field_class.py` owning the field class and coordinate machinery;
   the wout-to-mgrid path belongs with the existing `mgrid.py`. Then decide the
   ESSOS boundary: ESSOS already owns fields that expose B and grad B and does
   the field-line tracing, so some of this is arguably its code — but VMEX must
   still deliver B, grad B, and their VJPs with no coils and no ESSOS. Draw
   that line deliberately across the ecosystem rather than per-file.
7. **`statephysics.py` -> `diagnostics.py`**, and pull the simple diagnostics
   scattered in other modules into it.
8. **`core/` -> `optimizables/`** for the modules that are objectives or
   diagnostics rather than solver core: `bootstrap`, `maxj`, `qi`, `omnigenity`,
   `stability`, and the diagnostics module above.

Sequencing note: 5 and 7 are cheap and can land immediately; 1-4 are
cross-repo and need the sibling PR first, then a VMEX PR that deletes code.
Do not start 6 or 8 until 1-4 have settled, or the files will move twice.

## Phase 16 — Review items on physics, examples, and documentation

1. **Infinite-n ideal-ballooning growth rate.** Test it, then add
   `examples/optimization/QA_optimization_ballooning.py`. Value and gradient
   both need to be accurate and fast. Study DESC's formulation and improve on
   it with SOLVAX's primitives rather than porting it.
2. **`take_fixed_boundary_gradients.py`** [DONE, `ff613b27`] — companion to the
   free-boundary example, no ESSOS, certified at 3.8e-6.
3. **Drop `examples/epsilon_effective.py`.** Replace with per-optimizable
   documentation pages: one page each, with the equations, the model, the
   variants, how to compute it and how to differentiate it. That page set is
   the deliverable, not a script per diagnostic.
4. **Prose sweep** [PARTIAL, `ff613b27`] — the "not X, it's Y" construction and
   words like "grinding" removed from the code touched in this pass. The README
   and docs still need the same read-through.
5. **Certifier warning and progress output** [DONE, `ff613b27`] — the warning
   now names its live settings and the consequence of changing them; the
   heartbeat is silent for fast calls; every optimization script documents the
   knobs; asymmetric examples write their staged boundary.
6. **`pressure_balance_residual` and the normal-field terms** [PARTIAL,
   `ff613b27`] — docstrings explain why finite beta needs pressure continuity
   where a zero-beta single stage does not, and what the residual and the
   excess hinge each measure. Still owed: the full documentation page with the
   derivation.

## Phase 17 — Why asymmetric quasisymmetry optimization underperforms

The open physics question from the review, and the most important item here:
stellarator-symmetric runs reach good quasisymmetry at max_mode 1, while the
LASYM runs do not get close. Established so far: the cost per evaluation is
only 1.8x symmetric, and the stall was a solver artifact now fixed, so slowness
is not the explanation. Work the correctness question directly.

**FOUND (2026-08-19): the asymmetric m=1 Jacobian is wrong.** The implicit
Jacobian disagrees with central finite differences by ~3% on exactly two dofs,
`RBS(0,1)` and `ZBC(0,1)` — the n=0, m=1 sine-R and cosine-Z modes — while every
other dof agrees to ~1e-8. Evidence, in order of strength:

- A step sweep h = 1e-4/1e-5/1e-6/1e-7 gives 3.042e-2 / 3.050e-2 / 3.047e-2 /
  3.729e-2. It plateaus, so this is an analytic-derivative error, not
  finite-difference noise; symmetric dofs converge to ~1e-8 in the same sweep.
- Resolving the pair into channels localizes it exactly: along `RBS+ZBC` the
  Jacobian is right to 2.9e-9, along `RBS-ZBC` it is wrong by 1.6e-1, and a
  symmetric control dof is right to 8.2e-10 (4th-order stencil). The per-dof 3%
  is a 16% error in one channel, diluted. This is the `zcc -> alpha*(rsc - zcc)`
  output of the asymmetric m=1 rotation in `vmex/core/residuals.py`
  (`_m1_rotate_asym`), whose n=0 branch is special-cased (`has_partner=False`,
  so `w_partner=0` and `half=1.0`).
- It is structural, not amplitude-dependent: the same error appears with the
  asymmetry amplitude set to exactly zero.
- The forward map is *correct*: a LASYM run with all sine-parity coefficients
  zeroed reproduces the symmetric run to 4.4e-9 on QS residual, aspect,
  magnetic well, iota and volume. Value right, derivative wrong.

**ROOT CAUSE AND FIX (2026-08-19).** Not the m=1 constraint in
`residuals.py` — that was audited and exonerated (`_m1_rotate_asym` is exactly
invertible at n=0, round trip 2.2e-16; the n=0 block is `[[1,1],[1,-1]]` at
alpha=1 and its exact inverse at alpha=0.5; matches `readin.f:678-692`, which
applies the constraint over the whole n range including n=0). No
`custom_vjp`/`stop_gradient`/`pure_callback` sits on that path, and the m=1
force masks are built from static NumPy mode tables, so they are fully traced.

The defect was a frozen discrete branch in `vmex/core/implicit.py`
(`_lasym_delta_rotation_traceable`):

    if float(np.arctan((s0[ntor, 1] - c0[ntor, 1]) / denom0)) == 0.0:
        return rbc, rbs, zbc, zbs

`readin.f:548-567` normalizes the LASYM boundary by a poloidal-angle shift
`delta` chosen so `RBS(0,1) = ZBC(0,1)`, guarded by `IF (delta .ne. zero)`.
That Fortran guard is a pure runtime shortcut with no semantic content —
`cos(0)=1`, `sin(0)=0` make the loop the identity — but vmex froze it from the
reference input as if it were a discrete decision like `lflip`. `delta == 0` is
not a discontinuity; it is where the map is the identity **in value but not in
derivative**. The true Jacobian still carries `d(coef)/dp += m*(partner)*
d(delta)/dp` for every `(m,n)`, and `d(delta)/d(RBS(0,1)) = +1/denom`,
`d(delta)/d(ZBC(0,1)) = -1/denom` — exactly equal and opposite, hence a rank-one
error confined to the antisymmetric channel, which is precisely the measured
signature. `d(delta)/d(RBC(0,1))` vanishes when `rbs01 = zbc01`, so the
symmetric dofs stayed exact.

Fix: delete the two lines; keep the `mpol < 2` and `denom0 == 0.0` guards, which
are structural (the latter is a division by zero, not a choice). Verified
end-to-end on the patched tree: the n=0 antisymmetric channel drops from
1.599e-1 to 2.98e-5 (h=1e-5) / 1.58e-7 (h=1e-6), and the per-dof sweep for
`RBS(0,1)`/`ZBC(0,1)` now *converges* with h (3.9e-5 -> 2.0e-5 -> 2.7e-8)
instead of sitting flat at 3.0e-2. Secondary consequence now also fixed: once an
optimizer moved `RBS(0,1) != ZBC(0,1)` away from a `delta0 == 0` reference, the
frozen guard made the **value** wrong too, so the AD and FD lanes were solving
different boundaries.

Why nothing caught it: both shipped LASYM decks have `delta0 != 0`
(`up_down_asymmetric_tokamak` 0.4636, `cth_like_free_bdy_lasym_small` 0.00236),
and `tests/test_implicit_grad.py:711` asserted values plus `isfinite` on the
gradient. Gate added — `test_lasym_delta_rotation_jacobian_at_zero_delta` puts
the reference exactly on `delta == 0` and compares the JVP along
`RBS(0,1) - ZBC(0,1)` against central differences of the `setup` reference; it
fails at 2.5 without the fix and passes at <=1e-7 with it, in 0.6 s.

Consequence: the optimizer received a wrong descent direction in half of the
n=0 asymmetric m=1 subspace, and past the reference point the exact and
finite-difference lanes were solving different boundaries. Every shipped
asymmetry family (nfp=1..4) was on that branch.

**Not yet shown to resolve the underperformance, however.** A bounded
12-evaluation LASYM QA stage before and after the fix reached QS 3.92e-1 and
4.64e-1 — no improvement. That harness was dominated by its iota-floor term
(`min|iota|` ~ 0.01 against a 0.42 target at weight 10), so quasisymmetry barely
moved in either lane and the test cannot discriminate. The Jacobian defect and
its fix rest on the finite-difference evidence, which is unambiguous; the
optimization payoff is a separate open question. Next measurement: a
QS-isolated stage (drop the iota and well rows, 30 evaluations) to get a signal
that is actually about quasisymmetry, and if that is still flat, treat the
underperformance as a second, independent cause and keep going down items 1-4
below rather than assuming this fix closed it.

**QS-isolated measurement (2026-08-19): the fix helps, modestly.** Dropping the
iota and well rows and running 30 evaluations, final QS is 4.097e-2 before the
fix and 3.432e-2 after (11.25x versus 13.43x reduction from the same seed), and
wall time halves, 149 s to 74 s. Both lanes now optimize quasisymmetry properly
once the iota floor is not eating the residual, so the earlier flat result was
a harness artifact, not evidence against the fix. Note also that after the fix
the optimizer drives `RBS(0,1)` and `ZBC(0,1)` to `-3.0e-2`/`+3.0e-2`, both on
the trust-region bound in the antisymmetric direction, where before only
`RBS(0,1)` reached it — the channel that was being mis-differentiated is
precisely the one the optimizer now uses. A 16% better final QS on one small
run is suggestive, not conclusive; the like-for-like symmetric-versus-LASYM
comparison in item 1 is the measurement that actually answers the phase.
Add a LASYM Jacobian-versus-finite-difference gate to the test suite covering
n=0 m=1 in both channels, since no existing test would have caught this.

1. **Done 2026-08-19, and it reframes the phase: the two runs were never
   starting from the same place.** Identical targets, stages, resolution and
   budget, QS-isolated, on the fixed tree:

   | | dofs | seed QS | final QS | reduction |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | symmetric | 8 | 1.209e-2 | 4.523e-4 | 26.7x |
   | LASYM | 16 | 4.608e-1 | 3.432e-2 | 13.4x |

   The LASYM run ends 76x worse — but it *starts* 38x worse. The examples'
   `ASYMMETRY_PERTURBATION = 0.01` on `RBS(1,1)`/`ZBC(1,1)`, added to keep the
   optimizer off the symmetric stationary subspace, degrades quasisymmetry by a
   factor of 38 before a single evaluation, and 30 evaluations at max_mode 1 do
   not climb back. The per-evaluation reduction factor is within 2x of
   symmetric, which is a very different picture from "the asymmetric lane does
   not work".

   So the seed, not the optimizer, is the leading suspect for the reported
   underperformance. The perturbation exists for a real reason — scalar targets
   have zero derivative with respect to the asymmetric families at exactly zero
   asymmetry, so the optimizer would never leave — but it only has to break the
   symmetry, not wreck the configuration. Sweeping the amplitude (1e-3, 1e-4, 0)
   against the symmetric baseline is the measurement that settles both halves:
   whether a smaller seed matches or beats symmetric, and whether amplitude zero
   really is stationary. If a small amplitude recovers symmetric-quality QS, the
   fix is a one-line change to every asymmetry example and the phase is closed.

   **The sweep ran, and it refutes the seed hypothesis.** Amplitudes 1e-3, 1e-4
   and 0 all land on essentially the same final QS (3.423e-2, 3.434e-2,
   3.355e-2) and the same cost (~0.2947), regardless of where they start:

   | run | seed QS | final QS |
   |---|---|---|
   | symmetric | 1.209e-2 | **4.523e-4** |
   | LASYM amp=1e-2 | 4.608e-1 | 3.432e-2 |
   | LASYM amp=1e-3 | 1.638e-2 | 3.423e-2 |
   | LASYM amp=1e-4 | 1.213e-2 | 3.434e-2 |
   | LASYM amp=0 | 1.209e-2 | 3.355e-2 |

   At amplitude zero the LASYM run starts from *exactly* the symmetric seed
   (1.209067e-2 against 1.209283e-2) and still ends 74x worse, having made
   quasisymmetry 2.8x worse than where it began. Shrinking the seed does not
   help, so the seed is not the cause.

   Two things were ruled out along the way. The QS objective's two lanes agree
   exactly — `sum(residuals_state^2)` equals `total_state` to the last digit,
   and LASYM at zero asymmetry reproduces the symmetric values bit for bit — so
   the optimizer is not minimizing a different quantity from the one reported.
   And the harness was itself partly at fault: with an aspect-ratio row present
   the LASYM run was trading quasisymmetry for aspect (7.36 against 7.78) and
   reaching a *lower* total cost, so "final QS" was never the objective. The
   comparison is being redone with quasisymmetry as the only term, which makes
   cost and final QS the same number.

   What still stands as the anomaly: from an identical configuration, with the
   symmetric optimum inside its search space, the LASYM lane moves away from
   quasisymmetry. That is the thing to explain.

   **Resolved. With quasisymmetry as the only term, the anomaly disappears and
   the fix's payoff is visible.** Same seed (1.209e-2), same budget:

   | run | dofs | final QS | reduction |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | symmetric | 8 | 2.445e-4 | 49.5x |
   | LASYM amp=0, pre-fix | 16 | 2.436e-4 | 49.6x |
   | LASYM amp=0, post-fix | 16 | **1.599e-4** | **75.6x** |

   Before the fix the LASYM lane could only *match* symmetric: its eight extra
   asymmetric degrees of freedom bought nothing, which is exactly what a
   Jacobian that is wrong in the asymmetric m=1 channel predicts. After the fix
   it beats symmetric by 1.52x, which is what the extra freedom should buy given
   that the symmetric optimum is inside its search space. This is the
   end-to-end confirmation the derivative evidence could not supply on its own.

   So the reported underperformance was two separate things, neither of which
   is "the asymmetric lane does not work":

   - the frozen `delta == 0` branch, which silently neutralized the asymmetric
     m=1 freedom (fixed, #126); and
   - objective weighting in the examples themselves. With aspect, iota-floor and
     magnetic-well rows present, the extra asymmetric dofs get spent satisfying
     *those* terms — the LASYM run reached aspect 7.36 against symmetric's 7.78
     and a lower total cost while its quasisymmetry got worse. Add the
     `ASYMMETRY_PERTURBATION = 0.01` seed, which by itself degrades QS 38x
     before the first evaluation, and a run judged on final QS looks broken
     when it is merely optimizing what it was told to.

   Follow-up for the examples (not a vmex defect): revisit the weights and the
   seed amplitude in `examples/optimization/stellarator_asymmetry/`, and report
   quasisymmetry alongside the terms actually being minimized so the tradeoff
   is visible rather than looking like a failure.

   On the seed specifically, the examples' stated rationale does not survive
   measurement. `ASYMMETRY_PERTURBATION` exists to keep the optimizer "away from
   the symmetric stationary subspace", but the amp=0 run above started at
   *exactly* zero asymmetry and still reached 1.599e-4, beating symmetric's
   2.445e-4 — which is only possible if the asymmetric families moved. The
   subspace is stationary for the scalar total but not for the residual
   *vector*, and least squares sees the vector. So the perturbation is not
   needed to break the symmetry, while at 0.01 it costs a factor of 38 in
   starting quasisymmetry. Caveat on scope: this is one nfp=2 QA case at
   max_mode 1, mpol 3, with quasisymmetry as the only term. Confirm on a second
   family and with the full objective before changing all four examples.
2. **booz_xform_jax under LASYM: audited 2026-08-19, clean — but it is not in
   the loop for the QA/QH/QP asymmetry examples anyway.** The `bmns(i,i)`
   repeated-index bug was not copied in; the package has no per-mode scalar
   index loops, so the sine-parity arrays go through the same vectorized
   expressions as the cosine-parity ones. Verified against the reference C++
   `booz_xform` and the STELLOPT Fortran (`surface_solve.cpp`, `boozer.f`,
   `setup_booz.f`, `foranl.f`): every asymmetric sign matches, the full-theta
   grid is used with the half-weights correctly restricted to the symmetric
   branch and the normalization switched to match (no stale factor of two).
   Zero-asymmetry consistency on li383 at mboz=nboz=16 is 3.9e-15 worst case,
   and genuinely asymmetric cases agree with the C++ to 4.5e-14 (mboz=6) through
   3.7e-13 (mboz=32) — so the loose gate was never hiding a resolution-dependent
   error. Not yet verified: the JVP/gradient of the asymmetric kernel, the
   `streamed` Fourier mode, and free-boundary LASYM.

2a. **[DONE] Real defect found next door: `boozer_tables.py:124` truncates the
   VMEC Nyquist band.** `m_max, n_max = ntheta1 // 2 - 1, max(nzeta // 2 - 1, 0)`
   builds 41 modes (m<=4, |n|<=4) where the wout Nyquist set has 61 (m<=5,
   |n|<=5), dropping a band carrying 2.49% of `bmnc` and 2.77% of `bmns` on
   `input.basic_non_stellsym_simsopt`. That is the *entire* 2-3% discrepancy in
   the `test_omnigenity.py:139` gate: truncating the host reference to vmex's 41
   modes drops the difference from 1.60e-2/2.89e-2 to 1.06e-5/1.03e-4. Fix the
   mode set, then tighten that gate to the machine-precision level the kernel
   actually delivers. Two related asymmetries to fix with it, both in
   `omnigenity.py`: `_boozer_lasym_state` (line 209) ignores the `oversample`
   argument the symmetric branch honours, and the symmetric branch works from
   real-space `bmag` with FFT zero-padding so it never loses the band at all.
   Scope: this affects the QI asymmetric examples, which route through
   `QIResidual` -> `boozer_bmnc_state` -> booz_xform_jax. It does **not** affect
   the QA/QH/QP asymmetry examples, which use `QuasisymmetryRatioResidual`, a
   real-space wout-table residual with booz_xform nowhere in the loop.

   **Fixed on `fix/boozer-nyquist-band` (rebased onto main).** `m_max, n_max =
   ntheta1 // 2, nzeta // 2`, matching how `wrout.f` sizes the wout Nyquist
   table from the grid (`mnyq = ntheta1/2`, `nnyq = nzeta/2`). The weights
   needed care: the closing row and column are self-conjugate on an even grid,
   so they carry `2/(ntheta1*nzeta) * h_m * h_n` with `h = 0.5` on a fold, which
   is what `wrout.f`'s `cosmui(:,mnyq) *= 0.5` amounts to; odd grids keep the
   plain factor of two.

   One correction to my own brief, worth recording because acting on it would
   have reintroduced the error: the sine projection is *not* identically zero
   across the whole Nyquist row. It vanishes only at the four self-conjugate
   corners. At `m = ntheta1/2` with `n != 0, +-nzeta/2` the sine is genuinely
   nonzero and the wout carries it — `bmns(5, 1..4) = 2.029e-4, -3.026e-5,
   4.107e-5, -4.606e-5`, reproduced to all digits. Only the corners are zeroed.

   Result: the projection now reaches the wout Nyquist mode set exactly on four
   decks (symmetric and LASYM, even and odd `nzeta`, nfp=1 and 3), agreeing on
   every mode including the new band — worst case 2.87e-14, typically ~1e-16.
   The `test_omnigenity.py` gate tightened from 2e-2/3e-2 to 1.1e-4/1.1e-3
   against a measured 1.055e-5/1.025e-4, and a new
   `test_projection_closes_at_the_grid_nyquist_band` asserts the mode set equals
   the wout table, that the dropped band was non-negligible, and that the corner
   sines are exactly zero. `_boozer_lasym_state` now honours `oversample`.

   Blast radius, for the record: the symmetric `boozer_bmnc_state` lane builds
   its tables inline and never calls `boozer_input_tables`, so this only ever
   affected LASYM Boozer spectra and direct `boozer_input_tables` callers.

3. Audit the LASYM paths in vmex, booz_xform_jax, neo_jax, and
   virtual_casing_jax against the literature for sign and parity errors: the
   sine-parity conventions, the full-theta versus reduced-grid handling, and
   the m=1 constraint under `lconm1`. Check papers, other codes, and
   documentation rather than reasoning from the source alone.
4. Only after 1-3: ask whether the asymmetric optimum is genuinely worse, i.e.
   whether the extra families buy nothing for QA. That is a real possible
   answer, but it is the last hypothesis, not the first.

## Phase 18 — Multigrid restart transient

Each new radial resolution in `ns_array = [31, 51, 101]` restarts with very
large FSQR/FSQZ/FSQL at ITER 1. Analyze whether the interpolation onto the
finer grid is losing force balance that a better prolongation would keep, what
it costs in iterations, and whether VMEC++ (github.com/proximafusion/vmecpp)
solved it — read their restart/prolongation code. Report the implications and
the trade-offs before changing anything: a large initial residual is not by
itself wrong if the ladder still converges faster than a cold fine solve, which
is the comparison that matters.

## Phase 19 — Finite-beta single stage converging to a poor optimum

From the review: the finite-beta single stage flattens out around cost 2.89
with mediocre quasisymmetry and aspect ratio, and the suspected mechanism is
that a large plasma current satisfies the transform target cheaply, so the
shaping never has to. Phase 12's minimum-|iota| floor addresses the transform
part of this and needs re-measuring here now that it is in. Beyond that:
1. Diagnose first — log the vacuum versus current-carried share of the
   transform along the optimization (the P12.5 check), plus the bootstrap
   fraction and the current profile, and confirm the mechanism before
   redesigning the objective.
2. Candidate remedies, to weigh once the diagnosis is in: constrain or penalize
   the enclosed current directly; target vacuum-field transform rather than
   total; enforce the QS residual on the vacuum field as well; or stage the
   optimization so shaping is established at low beta before the pressure and
   current are ramped.

## Log (continued)

- 2026-08-19 rogeriojorge: PR #123 review captured as Phases 15-19. Applied to the PR in
  `ff613b27`: the evaluation heartbeat is silent unless a call outlives its interval (it was
  printing "residual done in 0.4 s" over the optimizer's own table); the uncertified-column
  warning reports its live `jacobian_adjoint_tol`/`jacobian_adjoint_maxiter`, states that those
  are the measured optimum and that no action is normally needed, and gives the two alternatives
  with consequences; the word "grinding" and the "not X, it's Y" phrasing are gone from the code
  touched here; all 19 optimization scripts document the knobs; the seven remaining asymmetric
  examples write their staged boundary each stage, matching the convention added by hand to
  `stellarator_asymmetry/QA_optimization.py`; `take_fixed_boundary_gradients.py` added; and
  `normal_field_residual`, `normal_field_excess` and `pressure_balance_residual` now carry
  docstrings explaining what each measures and why finite beta needs the pressure rows.
  Deferred with reasons: the ecosystem moves (Phase 15) need the sibling-package PRs first, and
  moving files before that would move them twice; the per-optimizable documentation pages
  (16.3), the ballooning metric and example (16.1), and the three investigations (17, 18, 19)
  are each their own piece of work. Phase 17 is the one to start with — an asymmetric run
  contains the symmetric configuration in its search space, so doing worse than symmetric points
  at a bug rather than at cost.

## Phase 20 — Standing pull-request ledger (updated 2026-08-21)

Only VMEX #122 and #125 remain open. The implementation PRs listed in the earlier version of
this phase have merged; their independent post-merge audit is Phase 24. This phase is a standing
exception to the usual “finish or close” policy:

1. **VMEX #125 — research-grade plan.** Keep open and keep current. Do not merge or close it.
   It is the authoritative, interruption-safe ledger; implementation work lands through small
   branches and is recorded here only after its evidence exists.
2. **VMEX #122 — alpha-particle tracing/loss fraction.** Keep open and do not close it. It is
   both a specification and an in-progress integration branch. Its current base
   `rj/simplify_examples` is historical; rebase only when Phase 21 has a dependency-clean slice,
   and preserve the design record even if the final implementation is split into smaller PRs.
3. **New VMEX work.** The next PR is the focused Phase 22/25 hardening branch. It must not absorb
   alpha tracing, epsilon effective, ecosystem file moves, or the larger boundary-Schur
   performance work. Small diffs keep derivative and CI regressions reviewable.

### Sibling PRs are in scope only at explicit ownership seams

- ESSOS #58 (reusable coil interfaces) and #61 (in-memory VMEC field plus differentiable loss)
  are green, open, and unreleased. They require independent ESSOS maintainer review and merge;
  VMEX contributors do not perform either action. Keep them last in the merge order. VMEX 0.6.0
  must remain usable against released ESSOS 0.16 and must not claim the new interfaces. Do not
  vendor their code into VMEX or pin a software release to a mutable branch.
- virtual_casing_jax, NEO_JAX, booz_xform_jax and SOLVAX own the generic algorithms listed in
  Phase 26. VMEX PRs should contain only equilibrium-specific adapters and physics.
- STELLOPT #501 is merged and the current `STELLOPT_new` build is the reference. #502 remains an
  upstream hygiene item, not a VMEX release blocker.

Current order: Phase 22 exactness -> Phase 25 CI hardening -> Phase 23 VMEX 0.6.0 -> Phase 3
boundary-Schur performance -> P4/P21 preparatory APIs -> P6/P7 neoclassical work -> Phase 15/26
code moves -> Phase 10 final slimming -> independent ESSOS maintainer review/merge of #58/#61
and ESSOS 0.17. PR #122 and #125 remain open throughout. Any VMEX slice that requires the new
ESSOS API waits unmerged or stays explicitly development-only until that external release exists.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — localized the LASYM underperformance to a wrong analytic Jacobian in the n=0 asymmetric m=1 difference channel (16% error); forward map verified correct.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — root cause is the frozen `delta == 0` branch in `implicit.py::_lasym_delta_rotation_traceable`; fixed, gated, verified end-to-end (1.6e-1 -> 1.6e-7).
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — opened vmex #126 with the delta-rotation fix and its regression gate; #119 is green and queued for merge.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — corrected the overclaim: the delta fix is proven as a derivative fix but did NOT improve a bounded QA stage; payoff still unmeasured.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — QS-isolated run shows the fix improves final QS 4.10e-2 -> 3.43e-2 and halves wall time; like-for-like sym vs LASYM now running.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — like-for-like shows LASYM starts 38x worse in QS because of the 0.01 seed perturbation, not that the lane is broken; amplitude sweep running.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — seed hypothesis refuted: LASYM at amp=0 starts from the symmetric seed and still ends 74x worse; QS lane consistency ruled out; QS-only rerun in flight.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — RESOLVED. QS-only: LASYM went from matching symmetric pre-fix (2.436e-4 vs 2.445e-4) to beating it post-fix (1.599e-4). Remainder is example objective weighting, not a code defect.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17.2a — Nyquist-band projection fixed and gated (2-3% -> ~1e-16 on the band); branch fix/boozer-nyquist-band rebased onto main.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 — measured that the asymmetry seed perturbation is unnecessary (amp=0 still beats symmetric) and costly (38x worse start); needs confirming on a second family.

### Phase 17 addendum — the frozen-branch defect class, swept

The `delta == 0` bug in #126 is an instance of a general antipattern: a Python
`if` evaluated eagerly on reference values, sitting on a path that is later
differentiated with respect to those same values, where the condition is a
*smooth* function being treated as a discrete choice. The whole differentiated
surface was swept for siblings on 2026-08-19.

**Why the existing coverage could not see it.**
`tests/test_implicit_grad.py::test_lasym_boundary_map_derivative_vs_fd` finite-
differences the traceable map *against itself*. Both lanes freeze the same
branch, so the check is structurally blind to this entire class. The audit built
the missing comparison — `jax.jvp` of `implicit.runtime_from_params` against
central differences of the host `solver.prepare_runtime` — over every RunSetup
field plus `rcon0/zcon0`, no solve, ~10 s for four decks. That harness
reproduces the known delta bug exactly (rel 1.00, flat in h, rank-one
antisymmetric) and should replace the self-FD test.

**One new defect [DONE, branch `fix/free-boundary-presf-scale`].**
`freeboundary_implicit.py` took `presf_ns_scale` as a host float from the
*reference* input at both adjoint call sites (`_projected_residual`, the default
`coupled_gcrot` lane, and `_host_boundary_schur_adjoint`) while
`runtime_from_params` traced `am` alongside it. The ratio
`pmass(1)/pmass(hs*(ns-1.5))` is smooth in `am`, which is an `ImplicitParams`
field the backward pass pulls through, and it enters the residual linearly via
the `funct3d.f` edge force `bsqvac + presf_ns_scale * pressure[-1]`. Value exact
at the reference point, derivative absent — the same signature as `delta`.
Measured on the preconditioned lane: relative error against the true residual
1.13, 0.855, 0.814 for `am[0..2]`, while agreeing with the frozen lane to ~1e-6,
which is exactly why nothing caught it. On the raw Schur lane the kept and
dropped terms nearly cancel and the column points the wrong way entirely
(rel 63.4, 4.13, 3.01).

Fixed with a traceable `_presf_ns_scale_traceable(params, inp, ns)` taking `am`
and `pres_scale` from the parameters, the `p_edge == 0` guard rewritten as a
safe-denominator `jnp.where` so the two_power family's `p(1) = 0` keeps a finite
derivative. The `_dof_mask` call site deliberately keeps the host float — it
only discovers discrete structural support — and now says so in a comment.

Note the shipped LASYM free-boundary test deck **is** affected, contrary to the
first reading: it is `power_series` with `d(presf)/d(am)` up to 2.35e-4. Only
`two_power` decks (`p(1) = 0` identically) were immune. Gate added,
`test_presf_ns_scale_is_differentiated_in_the_adjoint_lanes`, which fails 11/11
against the frozen behaviour and passes at rtol 1e-3 with the fix; the tolerance
is set by host finite-difference noise on `am` coefficients reaching 5e7, and
only has to separate a live derivative from a missing one.

**Minor, left open.** `freeboundary_implicit.py:170` overrides the traceably
rebuilt `rcon0/zcon0` with host-solve constants, dropping
`d(rcon0)/d(params.rbc)`, where the fixed-boundary lane traces it. Low impact —
`rcon0` depends only on edge geometry and the free-boundary input boundary is an
initial guess, not a dof — but it should either be traced for consistency or
carry a comment saying the omission is deliberate.

**Everything else came back clean**, and not merely by reading. Full
AD-versus-host-FD sweeps over all four boundary families, `phiedge`,
`pres_scale`, `curtor`, `am/ai/ac[0:3]` against every setup field: worst
relative error 1.2e-11 (solovev), 2.5e-9 (li383, 3D symmetric), 5.2e-11
(up_down asymmetric), 2.8e-9 (cth-like 3D lasym). `lflip` was confirmed
*genuinely* discontinuous and correctly frozen — engineered to sit on the
branch, it gives AD 0 against FD 1.0e4, which is `iotas/h`, a real value jump.
The remaining frozen conditions are integers, logical flags, or `m`/`n` parity.

One degenerate guard worth a follow-up: the frozen `denom == 0` in the delta
rotation is a genuine discontinuity, but VMEC's `readin.f:551` has **no** such
guard — it divides by zero and takes `ATAN(Inf) = pi/2`. If a reference deck ever
landed exactly there, vmex would return the unrotated boundary for every nearby
parameter while the host rotates by ~pi/2 — a value divergence, not just a
derivative one. Only reachable at `RBC(0,1) = ZBS(0,1) = 0` (no m=1 content).
Prefer a documented raise over the silent identity.

Not covered: an end-to-end free-boundary gradient check of the presf fix (it is
demonstrated at the residual-Jacobian level, which is the object the backward
pass pulls back, but not through a full coupled solve), and the objective-term
modules, which got a read rather than a numerical sweep.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 addendum — swept the frozen-branch defect class; found and fixed presf_ns_scale in both free-boundary adjoint lanes; fixed-boundary setup map verified clean to ~1e-9.

### Phase 17 addendum 2 — a test leak that PR CI structurally cannot catch

Found while validating the `presf_ns_scale` fix.
`tests/test_freeboundary_implicit.py::test_boundary_schur_adjoint_reproduces_the_coupled_gcrot_gradient`
fails with `ValueError: need at least one array to stack` when the file runs as
a whole and passes in isolation. It reproduces identically on a clean
`origin/main` worktree, so it is not caused by any of the fixes here.

Cause: `test_free_boundary_warm_failure_retries_once_from_cold` writes an
all-zero mask straight into the module-level caches —

    fbi._FREE_HOT_CACHE[cfg] = seed
    fbi._FREE_MASK_CACHE[fbi._mask_key(cfg)] = jax.tree.map(jnp.zeros_like, state)

— and never removes it. `monkeypatch` restores the patched function but knows
nothing about the dict mutation. `_mask_key` is
`(resolution, lconm1, ncurr, "free")`, which the later Schur test shares, so it
picks up the poisoned all-zero mask, finds no active edge dofs, and reaches
`freeboundary_implicit.py:496` with an empty column list. Fixed on
`fix/free-mask-cache-test-leak` by switching both writes to
`monkeypatch.setitem`, which restores them at teardown.

Worth recording that the cache key itself is **not** at fault — my first
reading was that it was too coarse for production use, and that is wrong. The
leak is purely test hygiene.

Why PR CI is green anyway: the two tests sit in *different* manifest selectors
(`pr-physics-core` and `pr-physics-field`), so they never share a process on a
pull request. `weekly-single-stage-free` runs the whole file and would hit it,
as does anyone running the file locally. `pytest-randomly` is not installed, so
the ordering is deterministic and this is a reliable failure, not a flake.

The general lesson for P11/CI work: a selector split that keeps two tests apart
also hides state leaking between them. Worth an explicit check that module-level
caches (`_FREE_MASK_CACHE`, `_FREE_HOT_CACHE`, `_PACK_TABLE_CACHE`,
`_FREE_LAST_RESULT`) are empty at teardown, rather than relying on the split.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P17 addendum — found a module-cache leak in test_freeboundary_implicit.py that PR CI cannot see because the two tests are in different selectors; fixed on fix/free-mask-cache-test-leak.

## Phase 21 — Alpha-particle tracing and a differentiable loss fraction

Turn #122 from a single script into a feature of vmex: `vmex --trace wout_XXX.nc`
on the command line, and alpha-particle loss fraction as an optimizable that a
boundary optimization can actually descend. **#122 does not merge as it
stands** — the script is the specification, not the deliverable.

### 21.1 ESSOS prerequisites [IMPLEMENTED IN OPEN PR — uwplasma/ESSOS#61; NOT RELEASED]

Two things block a differentiable loss fraction, both on the ESSOS side, both
verified by reading the source:

- `essos.fields.Vmec.__init__` (essos/fields.py:191) only accepts a
  `wout_filename` and opens it with `Dataset(...)`. A caller holding the
  spectral arrays in memory as traced JAX arrays — which is exactly what vmex
  has — cannot reach the field without writing a file, and the file write
  severs the gradient. Needs an array-based constructor that stores what it is
  given without a NumPy round trip.
- `Tracing.loss_fraction` (essos/dynamics.py:929) builds the answer from
  `trajectories_r >= r_max`, `argmax`, `bincount`, `cumsum`. Every step is
  piecewise constant in the trajectories, so `jax.grad` of
  `loss_lost_fraction` (essos/objective_functions.py:252) is identically zero.
  It is a correct diagnostic and a useless objective for a gradient method.

ESSOS#61 proposes `Vmec.from_arrays(...)` and `Tracing.soft_loss_fraction(r_max,
width)` with the matching `loss_soft_lost_fraction` objective. The surrogate is
`mean_i sigmoid((r_soft_i - r_max)/width)` with
`r_soft_i = sum_t r_i(t) * softmax_t(r_i(t)/width)`. The softmax-weighted mean
beats `width*logsumexp(r/width)` because the latter carries a
`width*log(n_times)` offset set by the save grid rather than the orbit.

Measured: the exact `loss_fraction` gradient is 0.0 as predicted; the surrogate
gradient is -1.34e-1 at width 0.02, and the surrogate converges on the exact
value as the width shrinks — 0.2510 at width 0.002 and 0.250049 at 0.001
against an exact 0.25. `from_arrays` reproduces the file route bit-for-bit on
`B`, `AbsB`, the surface and a traced trajectory. The exact diagnostic is
untouched.

**Two findings from that work change the vmex design below.**

*`rmnc`/`zmns` do not affect guiding-centre trajectories.* The flux-coordinate
orbit equations use `bsub*`, `bsup*`, `gmnc` and `bmnc` only; the geometry
coefficients enter just `to_xyz` and the Cartesian `B`. A gradient probe that
scales `rmnc`/`zmns` returns zero for both the exact and the soft loss. So
21.2 must route the boundary dependence through the *recomputed equilibrium's
field coefficients* — the whole point of having vmex in the loop — and a test
that perturbs geometry alone would look like a broken gradient when it is
physically correct.

*ESSOS `main` and `rj/coils_from_nearaxis` have diverged* (common ancestor
`4df878f`). No loss-fraction objective exists on `main` at all, and `main`'s
`Vmec.__init__` differs — no `raxis_cc`/`zaxis_cs`, no `s` argument. ESSOS#61
targets `main` with a `(field, particles, ...)` signature, which is the right
shape for a boundary optimization; reconciling it with the coil-dof signature
on the working branch is a separate job.

Before marking this item done: an independent ESSOS maintainer reviews and merges #61 against
current ESSOS `main`, does the same for compatible #58, and publishes ESSOS 0.17. VMEX then
installs that release in a clean environment and replaces any development-only nightly git pin
with the released version. VMEX contributors do not self-merge those PRs. Green checks on an open
branch are implementation evidence, not a completed dependency.

### 21.2 The traceable field-coefficient gap [TODO]

The adapter is the easy half. The real work is that **no traceable path in vmex
produces the coefficients ESSOS needs.** Measured, not assumed:

| builder | jnp calls | np calls | gradient |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nyquist.wout_field_tables` | 0 | 23 | none — pure host NumPy |
| `boozer_tables.boozer_input_tables` | 43 | 21 | traceable |

`Vmec.from_arrays` wants `bmnc, rmnc, zmns, bsubsmns, bsubumnc, bsubvmnc,
bsupumnc, bsupvmnc, gmnc` plus the mode tables and `Aminor_p`.
`boozer_input_tables` already delivers `bmnc`, `bsubumnc`, `bsubvmnc`, `rmnc`,
`zmns` and the LASYM partners, traceably, on a single half-mesh surface. It
does **not** deliver `bsupumnc`, `bsupvmnc`, `gmnc` or `bsubsmns`, and the only
code that does — `wout_field_tables` — is host NumPy end to end.

So the deliverable is a traceable Nyquist projection of `bsupu`, `bsupv`,
`sqrt(g)` and `bsubs`. The real-space quantities are already traceable in the
solver core (`fields.py` builds `bsupu`/`bsupv` from `phipog` and the lambda
derivatives; `geometry.half_mesh_jacobian` gives `sqrt(g)`), so what is missing
is only the analysis step, and `boozer_input_tables` is the worked example of
how to do that in JAX with the same trig tables. Extending that function, or a
sibling beside it in `boozer_tables.py`, is the smaller change than making
`wout_field_tables` traceable — that one also carries the jxbforce filtering
and the 1D diagnostics, none of which tracing needs.

Scope this honestly before starting: it is a real piece of numerics with a
correctness bar (the traceable projection must reproduce the NumPy one to
round-off on both symmetry modes), not a wrapper.

*Geometry alone carries no orbit gradient.* Guiding-centre motion in flux
coordinates uses `bsub*`, `bsup*`, `gmnc` and `bmnc`; `rmnc`/`zmns` enter only
`to_xyz` and the Cartesian `B`. A probe that perturbs `rmnc`/`zmns` returns
exactly zero for both the exact and the soft loss — correct physics, and it
would read as a broken gradient to anyone testing the obvious thing. The gate
must perturb the boundary and check the gradient arrives through the
recomputed field coefficients.

### 21.2b `vmex/core/tracing.py` [TODO]

Once 21.2 lands, the adapter is thin and a new module is justified on the same
one-concern-per-file grounds as `bootstrap.py` and `neoclassical.py`:

    trace_alphas(source, *, tmax=3e-4, nparticles=200, s=0.25, seed=42,
                 timestep=5e-7, times_to_trace=200, model="GuidingCenter")

taking a wout path or a solved equilibrium and returning `loss_fraction`,
`lost_times`, `trajectories` and the lost/unresolved/failed counts. The
optimizable keeps the established signature so it drops into
`VmecProblem.from_tuples`:

    alpha_loss_fraction(state, rt, *, tmax, nparticles, s, width, seed)

Keep the ESSOS import inside the call so vmex still imports without ESSOS,
matching the existing ESSOS-dependent examples.

### 21.3 `vmex --trace` [TODO]

One flag, dispatched like `--plot` and `--booz` in `vmex/core/cli.py`
(`_dispatch`, around line 1060). `vmex --trace wout_XXX.nc` prints the loss
fraction, the lost/unresolved/failed counts and the wall time, then writes the
figures the #122 script draws — trajectories, parallel velocity, loss fraction
against time, energy error — into `--outdir` using the existing figure-writing
convention. Accept the tracing knobs as optional flags with the defaults above.

### 21.4 `examples/optimization/loss_fraction_optimization.py` [TODO]

Minimize alpha losses over boundary coefficients. Deliberately small so it
runs: `tmax = 3e-4`, `nparticles_per_core = 25`, the smooth surrogate as the
objective, the exact loss fraction reported each stage so the user sees the
quantity they care about rather than the surrogate. Include an aspect-ratio row
and the min-|iota| floor, as the other optimization examples do, and honour
`VMEX_EXAMPLES_CI=1` with a short smoke configuration.

### 21.5 Coverage and cost [TODO]

Tracing is expensive, so the test lane must not trace anything large. Gate the
adapter with a handful of particles over a very short `tmax` and assert the
surrogate tracks the exact loss fraction as the width shrinks, plus a
`jax.grad` that is finite and nonzero — the property that the whole phase
exists to provide. Register it in `tests/manifest.json` under a physics
selector, and keep it off `pr-fast`.

### 21.6 Literature anchors [TODO]

Alpha confinement claims need a reference point, not just self-consistency.
Anchor against a published configuration with known loss behaviour and cite it
in the test: the standard candidates are Landreman & Paul's precise QA and QH
(PRL 128, 035001, 2022), whose alpha losses at reactor scale are documented, and
the ARIES-CS baseline for a case with substantial losses. Compare the ordering
of loss fractions between two such configurations rather than an absolute
number, which depends on the tracing model and particle count.

## Phase 22 — Exact implicit-Jacobian contract [IN REVIEW — draft PR #131]

**Contract.** “Exact implicit derivatives” means VMEX returns a derivative certified at the
current parameter point against the true linearized equilibrium residual. A fast response that
misses tolerance is diagnostic evidence, not a Jacobian. A Jacobian certified at a previous
point is also not exact at the current point. Failed equilibrium trials may use the documented,
differentiable penalty pair, but converged trials never silently receive an approximate or stale
derivative.

### 22.1 Local implementation inventory

The worktree named in the current checkpoint contains these deliberate changes:

- `_certifier_summary` retains maximum iterations, uncertified-column count, the worst residual
  norm and its requested tolerance. Typed failures therefore carry evidence rather than a bare
  boolean.
- `implicit_jacobian_method="auto"` tries the amortized block/forward response and recomputes the
  same point through the independent reverse-adjoint graph if any column misses its certificate.
- Explicit `"block_tridiagonal"` or `"forward_gmres"` raises `AdjointSolveError` with the evidence
  instead of presenting an approximate matrix as exact. Uncertified responses are not used for
  perturbation warm starts.
- `README.md`, `docs/reference/optimization.rst` and
  `docs/explanation/adjoint-gradients.md` say “certified,” document automatic fallback and
  distinguish forced advanced lanes.
- Touched implementation/tests: `vmex/core/{optimize,implicit}.py` and
  `tests/test_optimize.py`. The implementation is published in draft PR #131 and is not complete
  until remote CI and review pass.

The stale-key gap is closed in `b4a68570`: generic derivative failures reuse a memoized Jacobian
only when `last_jac_key` is the identical decision vector; a new point raises the original error.
Rejected equilibrium trials retain only the exact derivative of their documented smooth penalty.

### 22.2 Required tests and decisions

1. Cheap mocked contract tests: an uncertified block result makes `auto` call reverse at the
   same `x`; forced block/forward raises with iterations/residual/tolerance; reverse failure
   raises; no uncertified `dz` is stashed; a cached Jacobian is reused only at the identical key.
2. Existing numerical gates remain unchanged:
   `test_block_response_forward_transpose_and_fd`,
   `test_least_squares_implicit_jac_solver_block`, and the free-boundary Schur/coupled adjoint
   comparison. No tolerance is loosened to accommodate the policy.
3. Add the decisive end-to-end degraded LASYM QA gate at the captured hard iterate: compare
   automatic fallback against explicit reverse for the matrix and one optimizer step; assert
   no uncertified/stale derivative is returned, the cost descends, and the bounded test finishes
   within the documented budget. The production LASYM case now completes six evaluations in
   125 s (cost 21.70 -> 2.03; warm Jacobians 1.3-2.5 s) and all responses certify directly. An
   intentionally impossible `1e-16`, one-restart stress did trigger all 48 columns and the
   correct reverse-fallback warning, but its reverse graph exceeded the 4:53 diagnostic budget
   and was terminated. Do not add that artificial long case to PR CI. If a naturally degraded
   iterate recurs, retain it as the bounded same-point matrix/step comparison described here.
4. Test the scalar contracts across a compact matrix: symmetric/LASYM, vacuum/finite beta,
   fixed/free boundary, scalar objective and residual-vector objective. Compare
   `jax_value_and_grad`, `0.5*r@r` with `J.T@r`, directional central differences at a converged
   root, and JVP/VJP transpose identities. Record solves, wall time and peak RSS.
5. Unify only when the evidence permits it. Objective tuples should share value/residual term
   assembly and one certification policy; retain separate scalar reverse and residual-Jacobian
   linear algebra when their complexity differs. A single API is desirable; forcing every
   optimizer through one computational graph is not a goal.

Current PR #131 evidence: Schur/coupled comparison passed in 87.49 s; block-response
transpose/FD passed in 159.45 s; least-squares policy/physics comparison passed; and the normal
48-variable LASYM optimization completed as described above. Full local lanes passed: core 96
tests in 3:57, implicit response 59 in 6:43, and field API 64 in 2:29. Changed executable-line
coverage is 97.6%. Ruff, mypy (66 source files), docs prose, Sphinx `-W`, package build, workflow
YAML, manifest validation (97 modules, 1334 tests, 14 campaigns), and `git diff --check` passed.
Released ESSOS 0.16 passed the core coil/CLI and virtual-casing contracts (5 passed, one optional
skip). A raw-operator, block-preconditioned GCROT replacement was tried and reverted because its
internal success status still left a 5.16e-5 transpose-identity error; any future Krylov change
must certify the explicit true raw residual rather than trust solver status.

Acceptance: every public derivative at a converged point is current-point certified or raises a
typed error; rejected-trial penalties are value/derivative consistent; the degraded LASYM case
descends with no stale fallback; focused tests and full remote CI pass.

## Phase 23 — VMEX 0.6.0 release [IN REVIEW — draft PRs #131--#135]

Scope freeze: 0.6.0 contains the already merged post-#123 features plus the small Phase 22/25
hardening work. Alpha loss, the larger boundary-Schur performance rewrite, epsilon-effective
objective work, broad ecosystem file moves and history rewriting are post-0.6 unless already
merged and independently certified. A release is a verified artifact, not merely a tag.

Release gates, in order:

1. Merge the focused Phase 22/25 hardening PR after full CI. Resolve the three audit debts in
   Phase 24 or explicitly list a narrowly justified deferral in the changelog.
2. Audit VMEX against released ESSOS 0.16. Remove, defer or clearly development-gate any code,
   example or documentation that requires open ESSOS #58/#61; VMEX 0.6 must neither advertise
   nor require those unreleased APIs. Their independent review, merge and ESSOS 0.17 release are
   deliberately last and are not VMEX 0.6 release gates. The 2026-08-21 audit found nine
   development-only scripts: both `vmex_fieldline_tracing_*` examples; the fixed- and
   free-boundary `single_stage_optimization*` vacuum/finite-beta examples;
   `vmex_get_B_outside_plasma.py`, `vmex_fixed_free_boundary_comparison.py`, and
   `take_free_boundary_gradients.py`. They use `Coils.from_json/with_dofs/dof_names`, ESSOS
   distance objectives, `surfacerzfourier_from_boundary`, or the new tracing helpers, none of
   which is in released 0.16. Keep the release-compatible `free_boundary_essos_coils.py`, mirror
   construction, CLI tabulation and VMEX/VC contracts. Draft PR #132 implements this boundary:
   the nine scripts fail immediately with one explicit development-preview message on 0.16,
   stable documentation claims and the unreleased Nightly pin are removed, and the three compact
   coil fixtures retain the public `dofs_curves` / `dofs_currents` schema read by 0.16 and the
   development loader. Do not duplicate these helpers in VMEX. Restore the stable examples only
   after an independent ESSOS 0.17 release.
3. Manually dispatch and pass current Nightly, Weekly and GPU campaigns at the candidate SHA.
   Nightly run 32543383359 is fully green: optional integrations 5:40, QA 2:36, QI 2:35,
   QP 3:01 and QH 4:04. The former Weekly design was not acceptable release evidence even when
   green: run 31236274932 took 2:42:53 for high-mode free boundary and 1:29:27 for mirrors.
   Draft PR #135 keeps the physical oracles but bounds and shards them. Its first run
   32546262891 passed adjoint/fixed/free in 5:55/16:21/48:45, while the three-beta mirror
   refinement reached the enforced one-hour boundary. Run 32549286300 then passed adjoint,
   fixed and the revised mirror jobs in 2:55/9:37/55:01; the former 15->25 radial free-boundary
   ladder reached the same cap. Head `a4e4b37f` changes only that ladder to 11->19 while keeping
   all 238 Fourier modes, vacuum activation, the real restart, 1e-8 convergence and VMEC2000
   parity. It passed locally in 17:45; an independent VMEC2000 solve converged both rungs,
   activated vacuum at iteration 39 and supplies the checked `r00`, `wb` and edge-iota oracle.
   PR run 32554820509 is fully green, including changed-line coverage and the aggregate gate;
   final Weekly run 32554856698 passed adjoint/fixed/mirror/free in 4:45/16:17/47:54/56:43,
   all below the one-hour per-job bound. GPU run 32543384593 was cancelled as nonqualifying
   after read-only
   inspection found two unrelated nonlinear campaigns occupying both office GPUs. Dispatch a
   fresh ephemeral runner only after those processes finish. Record its final URL and elapsed
   time in the release log; do not waive the pending GPU campaign.
4. Draft PR #134 updates `pyproject.toml` to 0.6.0 and finalizes
   `docs/project/changelog.md`. Its release workflow installs both wheel and sdist into clean
   Python 3.10 and 3.12 jobs, imports VMEX outside the source tree and runs a converged 7-surface
   solve from the packaged seed. Manual dispatch is build/verify-only; only a published release
   may enter the PyPI job. Local Python 3.12 wheel/sdist installs pass, and the artifacts are
   573 KiB / 894 KiB versus the 576 KiB / 896 KiB baseline. Dispatch the four-job remote matrix
   and record it before merging. The first dispatch exposed that `setup-python` cannot use pip
   caching without a checked-out dependency file in the intentionally source-free verifier;
   removing only that cache option fixed the workflow. Corrected run 32542322776 passed build
   plus wheel/sdist installs on Python 3.10 and 3.12, with publish and make-latest skipped.
5. Tag `v0.6.0`, publish through the trusted PyPI workflow, and make the software release
   GitHub's latest. The local workflow change adds a post-publish `make_latest=true` step so an
   assets release no longer owns `/releases/latest`; preserve asset releases and provenance.
6. Verify PyPI metadata/install, GitHub release assets, docs links, badge versions, CLI version,
   and `/releases/latest`. Only then mark Phase 23 done.

PR #122 and #125 stay open throughout and after this release. Never merge either merely to empty
the pull-request queue.

## Phase 24 — Independent audit of the ten post-#123 merges [PARTIAL]

All ten PRs had green CI but no GitHub review; green checks are not independent review. The
54-commit history is not rewritten. Preserve it and close debts with small follow-up PRs.

- Accepted as merged after source/diff review: #116, #117, #119, #121, #126 and #127.
- #129 is acceptable; optionally centralize its cache cleanup in one scoped fixture if another
  cache leak appears. Do not add a broad autouse reset that hides production cache semantics.
- #128 follow-up is in review as stacked draft PR #133. Its solved free-boundary objective
  gradient is `1.776e-5` versus `1.705e-5` from independent centered cold resolves (4.2%); the
  former frozen normalization gives `7.579e-2`, over 4,000 times the resolved derivative. The
  test passes twice in about 79 seconds and belongs to the bounded weekly adjoint campaign.
- #130 is accepted after a fresh, bounded full campaign. The max-mode 1--9 QA ladder reduced QS
  from `8.98e-2` to `5.75e-5`; the independent `ns=101`, `ftol=1e-14` final solve converged in
  3,873 iterations with QS `6.12e-5`, aspect 3.5000, mean iota -0.4340 and magnetic well 0.0687.
  Wall time was 2,299 s (38.3 min). This is manual release evidence, not a CI candidate.
- #118 is accepted. The merged fixture is not vacuum: it solves at total beta `2.24e-4` with a
  4.79 kPa peak pressure and `max(abs(DWell)) = 4.58e-5`. Its pinned `DWell`, `DShear`, `DCurr`
  and `DGeod` arrays come from STELLOPT `v6.5.0-42-g9177f58c`; the live VMEC2000 parity test was
  rerun against that build in 8.5 seconds, and both pinned decomposition/DMerc gates pass. The
  earlier vacuum-only assessment had overlooked the fixture's explicit pressure override, so
  no redundant oracle or data file is needed.

Acceptance: the three named debts have literature/reference-anchored tests or recorded bounded
campaign evidence; no published history rewrite; Phase 23 explicitly accounts for each.

## Phase 25 — CI and example-integration runtime [COMPLETE IN DRAFT PR #131 — AWAITING REVIEW]

Measured on `main` CI run 32340328989: core 19:42, field API 19:53,
implicit-response 12:46 and mirror-spline 9:14. Dominant individual tests were the Schur/coupled
comparison (791 s), free-boundary current FD (347 s), block response (256 s), free-boundary
restart (217 s), least-squares implicit block (193 s) and bootstrap-current dofs (117 s).
Nightly run 32448443577 completed successfully; its bounded example job took 17:58, dominated by
outside-field (278 s), gradB (262 s), finite-beta single stage (217 s), fixed single stage
(190 s), finite-beta tracing (74 s) and vacuum tracing (58 s).

Local changes use `pytest -n 2` for core and field-API lanes while keeping JAX-heavy implicit
and mirror lanes serial; six independent nightly examples also use two workers. The PR-lane
Schur/coupled test uses a real LASYM DIII-D case at `mpol=10, ntheta=30`; local scans showed
`mpol=4` invalid and `mpol=8` missed the 2% physics gate by 2.896%, while `mpol=10` passed and
reduced this test from the remote 791 s baseline to 127.6 s. The full high-resolution FD
certificate remains nightly. No assertion or tolerance was removed.

The final manifest preserves every selected physics test while separating incompatible compile
shapes: core is 95 tests in 2:57 locally, implicit-A is 9 in 3:22, implicit-B is 15 in 3:53, and
the isolated free-boundary adjoint is 1 in 1:19. Field API remains 64 tests in 2:29 against
released ESSOS 0.16. Two fast certificate-policy tests were added to implicit-B so changed-line
coverage is exercised by a selected physics job. These are evidence for the scheduling change,
not completion: the acceptance criterion still requires two consecutive remote runs within
budget.

The first remote run at `b4a68570` was diagnostic, not qualifying: field API improved to 8:54,
but implicit response regressed from the 12:46 baseline to 16:45 because two GitHub-runner
workers contended while compiling JAX programs. Commit `0e991596` therefore restores that lane
to serial execution. Do not count the diagnostic run toward the two-run acceptance criterion.

The serial replacement at `0e991596` measured core 15:03, field 8:50 and implicit 14:55, but its
changed-line gate failed because four already-passing certificate-policy lines were absent from
the selected physics manifest. The stacked #132 run measured core 13:48 and implicit 19:16,
showing that one large serial JAX lane still had unacceptable variance. Commit `326ba760`
therefore adds the two policy tests to the selected set and shards the unchanged long contract
by compile shape. The fresh run results are recorded below; neither prior run qualifies.

The final design has now passed two consecutive remote measurements with changed-line coverage
and the aggregate PR gate green. Run
[`32536701497`](https://github.com/uwplasma/vmex/actions/runs/32536701497) measured core 11:00,
implicit-A 9:19, implicit-B 11:12, free-boundary adjoint 6:31, field API 6:47 and mirror spline
10:04. Stacked run
[`32536709789`](https://github.com/uwplasma/vmex/actions/runs/32536709789) measured core 10:53,
implicit-A 9:34, implicit-B 11:20, free-boundary adjoint 7:10, field API 9:05 and mirror spline
10:04. Every job was below 12 minutes; no physics assertion, resolution or tolerance was
weakened. Phase 25's acceptance criterion is met.

Retained policy:

1. Run the entire workflow remotely. Reject `-n 2` in a lane if RSS, JAX cache interactions or
   wall time regress; parallelism is a measured policy, not a universal default.
2. Keep pull-request critical path <= 15 minutes and scheduled Nightly <= 30 minutes on GitHub
   runners, with no individual Nightly test over 10 minutes. Weekly production-resolution
   contracts may be longer only when isolated in <=60-minute jobs with measured local/remote
   evidence. Use manifest sharding and shared compiled shapes before resolution reductions.
3. Preserve one process-order cache-leak campaign because selector sharding previously hid a
   module-cache leak. Randomize/order-check cheaply rather than duplicating all physics solves.
4. Report per-test timing artifacts and fail on missing manifest coverage. Production-size
   parity, GPU and memory campaigns run nightly/weekly; pull requests retain the cheapest real
   physics case that distinguishes a wrong implementation.

Acceptance: two consecutive remote runs meet the budgets without weakened physics, coverage or
numerical tolerances; all changed lanes stay below memory limits; timings are retained for the
next audit.

## Phase 26 — Ecosystem ownership and dependency releases [ACTIVE POLICY]

Ownership follows the physics, with thin VMEX adapters and no vendored copies:

- **VMEX:** fixed/free equilibrium physics, VMEC inputs/state/parameter maps, NESTOR coupling,
  equilibrium diagnostics/objectives, implicit derivative policy and VMEC-specific adapters.
- **ESSOS:** coil geometry/current dofs, Biot-Savart fields, particle/field-line tracing,
  termination events and loss diagnostics/surrogates. VMEX examples consume its public release.
- **virtual_casing_jax:** boundary-integral kernels, singular quadrature plans, batching/sharding
  and custom VJPs. VMEX keeps only state/wout-to-surface adaptation and pressure interpretation.
- **NEO_JAX:** effective-ripple and generic neoclassical kernels. VMEX keeps a thin equilibrium
  adapter and objective composition; no second NEO implementation.
- **SOLVAX:** generic Krylov, block-tridiagonal, sparse, bordered/Schur and nonlinear-solve
  algebra. VMEX retains NESTOR edge physics, Fourier constraints, operator construction and the
  true-residual certificate.
- **booz_xform_jax:** generic Boozer transform/projection and derivatives. VMEX retains
  equilibrium-to-Boozer adapters and QI/max-J physics objectives.

After 0.6.0, the highest-value deletion target is VMEX's 781-line virtual-casing implementation
once virtual_casing_jax provides the complete API; generic Boozer projection is next. Do not move
`statephysics.py` or reorganize `core/` until cross-repo moves settle, or files will move twice.
The local NEO_JAX checkout is heavily diverged (ahead 72/behind 76); reconcile it against origin
before treating it as an authority.

For Phase 3 boundary-Schur work: instrument true coupled matvec count/time first; precondition
the transpose with the bulk `A^-T` block solve and a boundary Schur correction; put generic
bordered/low-rank/recycling algebra in SOLVAX; keep `E=J-A`, edge mode pairing and the true
coupled certificate in VMEX. Profile CPU correctness before GPU memory/kernel work.

Acceptance: each generic algorithm has one owner and one released implementation; VMEX optional
dependencies use releases, not mutable branches; cross-repo parity tests protect adapters; moves
delete more VMEX code than they add. ESSOS PR merges are performed only by an independent ESSOS
maintainer and remain last in the program order.

## Phase 27 — Final research-grade capability audit [PLANNED, CONTINUOUS]

Before declaring the program complete, run one final matrix and close every unsupported cell
explicitly. This phase collects goals that span several implementation phases:

1. Solver: fixed/free, vacuum/finite beta, axisymmetric/3-D, symmetric/LASYM, stellarator and
   axisymmetric/non-axisymmetric mirror equilibria; hot restart and single-resolution versus
   multigrid behavior; robust magnetic axis; VMEC2000/VMEC++ parity and typed non-convergence.
   Make forward controls (`ns_array`, `ftol_array`, `niter_array`, `delt`, force-residual/FSQ
   thresholds and verbosity) consistent across Python/CLI, user-adjustable and documented;
   state the immutable `VmecInput` copy/`replace` contract explicitly.
2. Optimization: tuple residual composition plus scalar `value_and_grad` with least squares,
   BFGS/L-BFGS-B, Adam/Optax and JAXopt examples; QA/QH/QP/QI at representative NFP/modes;
   finite-beta self-consistent bootstrap/current splines; fixed/free single stage; honest term
   histories and dof names. Examples teach the public gradients rather than hide them.
3. Physics: QI and QA max-J verified from second-adiabatic-invariant contours and radial trend;
   magnetic well, Mercier and Glasser with meaningful finite pressure; edge-weighted residuals
   documented wherever the axis/edge is excluded or emphasized; L_gradB/L_gradgradB; trapped
   fraction, effective ripple, gamma-c and J contours; alpha confinement ordering.
4. Fields/coils: Cartesian and flux-coordinate `set_points`, B/absB/gradB through third
   derivative and all VJPs inside/outside; coils plus virtual casing at finite beta; B.n/B and
   field-line agreement; progress/stopping; fixed/free comparison; publication-ready plots,
   VTK and optional compact movies. Define and test the magnetic-axis limit/extrapolation rather
   than leaving an unexplained singular point in the public API.
5. Product: concise README with only key figures and commands; full equations, algorithms,
   tutorials, CLI/restart/parallel controls in docs; all example scripts follow the agreed
   top-input/no-argparse template unless explicitly classified as tools; outputs ignored; no
   personal paths, stale hosts, scaffolds or oversized obsolete assets.
6. Quality/performance: >=95% source and branch coverage with per-physics floors; analytic,
   literature and independent-code anchors; PR/nightly budgets from P25; CPU/GPU peak-memory and
   throughput records; clean Python 3.10/3.12 artifacts; release/latest verification.

Every cell receives `[DONE evidence]`, `[DEFERRED reason/release]`, or `[UNSUPPORTED documented]`
before the final roadmap is called complete. “Example ran once” and text-grep tests are not
evidence. Add new requirements here and route them to an owning phase rather than creating an
untracked side plan.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P21 — planned the tracing feature; ESSOS PR for the array constructor and smooth surrogate in flight; #122 stays open as the specification.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P21.1 done — ESSOS#61 adds Vmec.from_arrays and a soft loss fraction (exact grad 0.0 -> surrogate -1.34e-1, converging to 0.250049 at width 1e-3); geometry coefficients carry no orbit gradient, so 21.2 must go through the field coefficients.

### Reference toolchain (2026-08-19)

`/Users/rogeriojorge/local/STELLOPT` is pinned at `512375ce` (2024-01-31) and
**carries the NEO reader bug**: `read_booz_in.f90:143` reads `bmns(i,i)`. Any
LASYM effective-ripple reference generated from that tree is wrong.

A current tree is built at `/Users/rogeriojorge/local/STELLOPT_new`
(`9177f58c`, `v6.5.0-42-g9177f58`), which has `bmns(i,k)` — the merged #501 fix.
Binaries in `STELLOPT_new/bin`: `xvmec2000`, `xbooz_xform`, `xneo`, built with
`MACHINE=macports`, gfortran 13.4.0, `-O2 -march=native`, NETCDF/FFTW/HDF5/MPI.

Use `STELLOPT_new` for every reference run from here. Point the live tests at
it with `--run-vmec2000 --vmec2000-executable=.../STELLOPT_new/bin/xvmec2000`,
and record which tree produced any golden array that gets pinned — the two
trees are two and a half years apart and disagree on LASYM.
- 2026-08-19 claude: built STELLOPT_new (9177f58c) with xvmec2000/xbooz_xform/xneo; confirmed #501 merged, so the old 2024 tree's bmns(i,i) bug no longer constrains LASYM NEO references.
- 2026-08-19 claude: P21.2 corrected — measured that wout_field_tables is host NumPy (0 jnp) so it carries no gradient; the deliverable is a traceable Nyquist projection of bsup/gmnc/bsubs beside boozer_input_tables, not a wrapper.

### LASYM verification against the current reference (2026-08-19)

Every LASYM claim in #118 re-checked against freshly built STELLOPT_new
binaries rather than the 2024 tree. All hold:

| claim | measured | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| pinned `DMerc` array is genuine xvmec2000 output | 2.67e-9 per-element vs a fresh run | holds |
| `d_merc_state` vs xvmec2000 | 6.302e-4 per-element, 1.581e-4 scale-relative | holds |
| pinned `<J.B>` array is genuine | 2.12e-15 per-element | holds |
| `jdotb_state` vs xvmec2000 | 1.519e-3 per-element, 1.512e-4 scale-relative | holds, 1.3x margin |
| shipped golden wout is current | zero difference on all 121 variables | not stale |
| booz_xform_jax vs `xbooz_xform`, lasym | 1.8e-14 / 2.3e-14 (nfp=1), 1.0e-15 / 8.0e-16 (nfp=5) | holds |

The live `--run-vmec2000` LASYM parity tests **pass** on this build (3 passed).
An earlier report of them failing came from the 2024 tree; those failures were
the reference, not vmex.

**Upstream moved the normalization and every citation of it was stale.**
STELLOPT_new's `fixaray.f:105` sets `dnorm = 1/(nzeta*(ntheta2-1))`
unconditionally — no lasym branch — and `jxbforce.f:233` has
`dnorm1 = 2*dnorm1` **commented out**. The 2024 tree had the lasym branch and
the active doubling. The two routes give the same number
(`2 * 1/(nzeta*2*(ntheta2-1))` = `1/(nzeta*(ntheta2-1))`), so vmex's value was
always right, and `fourier.py:282-283` already matches the current tree
exactly. Six prose sites cited the old mechanism as present-tense fact and now
describe the net weight instead; `SPH012314` no longer appears anywhere in
vmex. Worth remembering: `fourier.py`'s module docstring had been contradicting
its own code 250 lines below.

Two gaps worth closing later, neither blocking:
- Both LASYM goldens are non-converged runs. `up_down` NITER-exhausts
  (fsqz 1.11e-13 against ftol 1e-14), and `cth_like_free_bdy_lasym_small` sits
  at fsqr 0.129. A fresh run reproduces both faithfully, so they are valid
  bit-reproducibility fixtures, but neither is a physics anchor.
- `confinement.rst` calls the bundled deck "finite-beta"; it ships `AM = 0.0`,
  so `presf` and `DWell` are identically zero and finite beta exists only as a
  test-fixture override. No LASYM golden exercises `DWell` against VMEC2000.
- 2026-08-19 claude: verified every #118 LASYM claim against STELLOPT_new; all hold, goldens are current, live tests pass. Upstream refactored the dnorm mechanism, so six citations were rewritten to the net weight.

### Two judgment calls left for the maintainer

**"Experimental" labels.** `examples/README.md:64` and
`docs/explanation/adjoint-gradients.md:92` describe the coupled NESTOR adjoint
and the free-boundary Schur lane as experimental, and `docs/all-of-vmex.md:103`
says the same of GPU support. The no-experimental-lanes rule is about scaffolds
and dead alternatives in the source, and there are none — `vmex/` has no TODO,
FIXME, HACK, testbed or experimental marker anywhere. These three are honest
maturity caveats on shipped lanes, and the free-boundary one has earned it: a
real derivative defect turned up there today (#128). Deleting the word would
overstate readiness, so they stay until the lane is anchored end to end.
(`docs/project/changelog.md` is exempt by definition.)

**Repo size** is fine: `docs/_build` is 30 MB locally but untracked and
gitignored, and no PR in the queue adds a data file.
- 2026-08-19 claude: added a LASYM Mercier decomposition anchor (DWell 1.5e-7, DShear 7.6e-10, DCurr 2.2e-3, DGeod 3.2e-3 vs fresh xvmec2000); corrected the finite-beta doc claim; repo-wide scaffold scan clean.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: reconciled the full plan against `main` at `0362f701` and the
  post-#123 audit. Added the interruption-safe checkpoint and research-grade completion map;
  made #122/#125 persistent open specification/ledger PRs; corrected ESSOS #61 from “done” to
  open/unreleased; recorded P22's exact fail-closed Jacobian contract and remaining stale-key
  gap, P23's 0.6.0 release gates, P24's three post-merge evidence debts, P25's measured CI
  bottlenecks and bounded parallelization, P26's ecosystem ownership, and P27's final capability
  matrix. The implementation remains uncommitted in `rj/release-0.6-hardening`; resume with the
  focused contract tests and degraded-LASYM end-to-end gate before publishing it.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: corrected the ESSOS authority and ordering. ESSOS #58/#61 require
  independent ESSOS maintainer review and merge, remain last in the program order, and do not
  block VMEX 0.6.0. VMEX 0.6 must work against released ESSOS 0.16 and defer or explicitly
  development-gate the new interfaces; after an external ESSOS 0.17 release, VMEX can replace
  any nightly branch pin and publish the compatibility follow-up.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P22/P25 — published draft PR #131 at `b4a68570`. Closed the stale-key
  Jacobian gap, added fail-closed certificate evidence and host/JAX policy tests, fixed the
  forward-GMRES certificate report, and retained exact rejected-trial penalty derivatives.
  Numerical derivative gates passed; normal LASYM cost fell 21.70 -> 2.03 in 125 s; local core,
  implicit and field lanes passed in 3:57, 6:43 and 2:29; changed-line coverage is 97.6%.
  Released ESSOS 0.16 passes VMEX's core coil/CLI/VC contracts. PR #131 remote CI/review and the
  Phase 23 ESSOS-facing example audit are next; #122/#125 stay open, and ESSOS #58/#61 stay last
  for independent ESSOS maintainer action.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P23.2 audit — released ESSOS 0.16 passes the VMEX core coil/CLI/VC
  contracts, but nine shipped examples use APIs available only in open ESSOS #58. The exact
  inventory and release treatment are now in P23.2: development-gate those scripts, remove them
  from stable 0.6 claims/Nightly, retain the released 0.16 examples, and never vendor the missing
  ESSOS functionality into VMEX. This is the next small PR after #131; ESSOS review/merge remains
  external and last.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P25 — PR #131's first remote run measured field API 8:54 but
  implicit response 16:45, worse than its 12:46 serial baseline and outside the 15-minute gate.
  Restored only the implicit-response lane to serial in `0e991596`; its replacement run and a
  second consecutive qualifying run are required before review/merge.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P23.2 — published stacked draft PR #132 at `292bcdac`. The audit found
  and fixed a real ESSOS 0.16 blocker: all three bundled coil JSONs used only unreleased loader
  keys. The key-only compatibility change preserves geometry to 6.7e-16 and currents to
  floating-point reconstruction precision; the real free-boundary example passes with both
  loaders in about 21 s. Nine 0.17-only examples are now explicit previews, and release CI no
  longer installs an unreleased ESSOS commit. #58/#61 remain external, independently reviewed,
  and last.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P25 — replaced the variable 14:55--19:16 monolithic implicit lane
  with two serial compile-shape lanes and an isolated free-boundary-adjoint lane in `326ba760`.
  The exact selected contract is preserved and two fast policy tests now cover the previously
  missed changed lines. Local timings are core 2:57, implicit-A 3:22, implicit-B 3:53 and the
  free-boundary adjoint 1:19; the new remote runs are pending and two qualifying runs remain
  mandatory.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P24 — published the #128 solved-gradient follow-up as stacked draft
  PR #133 at `31dd34b2`. Its independent cold-resolve certificate is 4.2% from the corrected
  adjoint and fails the former frozen normalization by over 4,000x. Accepted #130 after a fresh
  max-mode-9 QA campaign: final high-resolution QS `6.12e-5`, aspect 3.5000, iota -0.4340,
  magnetic well 0.0687, 3,873 final iterations and 38.3 minutes wall time.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P24 #118 re-audit — the supposed vacuum-only gap was stale. The
  merged LASYM fixture explicitly sets pressure and has beta `2.24e-4`, peak pressure 4.79 kPa
  and `max(abs(DWell)) = 4.58e-5`. The live per-term test passes against current local STELLOPT
  `v6.5.0-42-g9177f58c` in 8.5 seconds; the pinned decomposition and DMerc tests pass in 8.7
  seconds. No new asset or proxy is justified. All three named Phase-24 debts now have evidence;
  #128 remains in review as PR #133.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P25 acceptance — two consecutive remote runs are fully green,
  including changed-line coverage and the PR gate. Run 32536701497's longest jobs were
  implicit-B 11:12, core 11:00 and mirror spline 10:04; run 32536709789's were implicit-B 11:20,
  core 10:53 and mirror spline 10:04. Every lane stayed below 12 minutes without weaker physics,
  resolutions or tolerances. P25 is complete in draft PR #131 and awaits user review; no VMEX
  PR was merged. PR #133's own review CI was then started separately.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P24/P23 — PR #133 review CI is fully green; its longest jobs were
  core 11:21, implicit-B 10:54 and mirror spline 10:00. Published stacked draft PR #134 at
  `14553796` for the final 0.6.0 artifacts. It also closes a release-safety hole: manual dispatch
  previously entered the PyPI publish job, while the new workflow makes manual runs
  build/verify-only and requires a published GitHub release for PyPI. Local wheel/sdist builds
  are 573/894 KiB; both clean Python 3.12 installs report 0.6.0 and converge the smoke solve.
  PR #134 review CI and docs linkcheck are green. Corrected manual run 32542322776 passed the
  source-free wheel/sdist verification on Python 3.10 and 3.12; publish/latest jobs were skipped.
  No PR was merged and no tag, release or package publication was performed.
- 2026-08-21 rogeriojorge: P23/P25 — candidate Nightly run 32543383359 is fully green; its
  longest optimization job was QH at 4:04 and optional integrations took 5:40. GPU run
  32543384593 was cancelled after both office GPUs were found occupied by unrelated nonlinear
  campaigns; it is nonqualifying and must be rerun uncontended. Audited the old Weekly success
  31236274932: the high-mode campaign took 2:41:53 (including a 7,550 s nonconvergent generated-
  coil test) and mirror refinement 1:29:27. Published stacked draft PR #135, now at `07b0181a`.
  It replaces that weaker survival test with the converged 238-mode free-boundary VMEC2000
  parity/radial-restart certificate, shards fixed/free high-mode jobs, retains the mirror
  0--80% continuation and original fine-grid tolerances, and caps each job at 60 minutes.
  Local fixed/free high-mode tests passed in 4:39/16:27. The first hosted run passed those jobs
  in 16:21/48:45 and the adjoint in 5:55, but its three-beta mirror refinement hit the one-hour
  cap. The exact fallback passed locally in 13:46: it keeps the 0--80% continuation/restart and
  fine-grid 0--10% convergence, without repeating the non-promoted 50% point. Hosted run
  32549286300 is pending.
- 2026-08-22 rogeriojorge: P23/P25 — finalized draft PR #135 at `a4e4b37f`. The second hosted
  run passed the revised mirror lane in 55:01 but showed that the 15->25 free-boundary radial
  ladder could still reach the one-hour boundary. Reduced only that ladder to 11->19 while
  retaining all 238 Fourier modes, vacuum activation, active-vacuum restart, 1e-8 convergence
  and VMEC2000 parity. The exact local test passed in 17:45; independent VMEC2000 goldens
  converged both rungs and agree in `r00`, `wb` and edge iota. PR run 32554820509 is fully green
  with its longest direct job at 10:50. Final Weekly run 32554856698 is fully green:
  adjoint/fixed/mirror/free 4:45/16:17/47:54/56:43. Nightly and all CPU gates now qualify; the
  sole remaining campaign gate is an uncontended trusted-GPU run after the user's unrelated
  office campaigns release both GPUs. ESSOS #58/#61 remain external, independently reviewed,
  and last; no VMEX PR, tag or release was merged or published.
