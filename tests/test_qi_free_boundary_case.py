"""Generated quasi-isodynamic free-boundary stress case (coils + mgrid).

Fully generated, no external asset: analytic filamentary modular coils are
tabulated onto a cylindrical grid (``tabulate_cartesian_field``) and
consumed exactly like a file-based mgrid.  The case couples the reported
stresses at once: finite pressure (so the free answer genuinely differs
from fixed), a delicate QI boundary, a coil field that does NOT hold the
prescribed boundary (the plasma must move), and a radial ladder crossing
the vacuum/NESTOR continuation.  A *stress* fixture, not a physics
benchmark: the assertions are about lawful solver behavior under strain.
