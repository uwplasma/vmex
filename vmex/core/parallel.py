"""Concurrent ensembles of independent equilibrium solves on CPU (Item G).

A parameter scan or an ensemble optimization solves ``N`` *independent*
equilibria (different boundaries / ``phiedge`` / profiles).  Each forward
solve runs on the host behind :func:`jax.pure_callback`
(:mod:`vmex.core.implicit`) or directly through
:func:`vmex.core.solver.solve` / :func:`vmex.core.multigrid.solve_multigrid`,
and — crucially — **releases the Python GIL while XLA executes the compiled
iteration lanes**.  A plain :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` over
those independent solves therefore overlaps their XLA execution and gives real
wall-clock speedup, while every result stays *byte-identical* to solving that
input alone (the solves share no mutable state).

Measured strong scaling (10-core host, 8 balanced ``phiedge`` solves): 1.79x
with 2 workers, 3.29x with 8.  The scaling is deliberately sub-linear: XLA
already multithreads *within* one solve, so as the worker count approaches
the core count the per-solve XLA threads contend — the ensemble speedup and
the intra-solve speedup draw from the same cores.  See :doc:`/parallelization`
for the full mechanism study (why threading beats ``pmap`` across forced host
devices and ``vmap`` over the callback here), the honest limits (Amdahl on
imbalanced heterogeneous ensembles; the launch-bound implicit adjoint
overlaps far less than the forward solve), and the multi-GPU design sketch.

This module is a thin, additive concurrency layer: it changes nothing in the
single-solve path (which stays byte-identical) and imposes no new dependency.
