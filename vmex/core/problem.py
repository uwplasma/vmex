    the ordinary callable methods and do not need to understand this object.

    Returned by :meth:`FunctionProblem.evaluate` and the two ``compile_*``
    helpers.  It is a report, not a cache: nothing here is consulted by a
    later evaluation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x:
        The decision vector the values were produced at, as an owned float
        copy with the shape of ``problem.x0``.
    value:
        Scalar objective at ``x``.  For a residual-only problem this is the
        least-squares cost ``0.5 * r @ r``, matching SciPy's
        ``OptimizeResult.cost``.  ``None`` when the problem exposes neither
        a scalar objective nor residuals.
    gradient:
        Gradient of ``value`` with respect to ``x``, reshaped to ``x``'s
        shape.  For a residual problem it is ``J.T @ r``.  ``None`` when
        ``derivatives=False`` was requested or no gradient lane exists.
    residual:
        The flattened residual vector ``r(x)``, or ``None`` for a
        scalar-only problem.
    jacobian:
        The residual Jacobian ``dr_i/dx_j`` with shape
        ``(residual.size, x.size)``, or ``None`` when derivatives were not
        requested or the problem provides no Jacobian.
    status:
        ``"success"``, or — from a VMEC-backed problem —
        ``"failed_solve"`` when the equilibrium solve at ``x`` raised, and
        ``"under_converged"`` when it returned but its force residual
        exceeds the threshold below which implicit derivatives are
        certified.
    message:
        Human-readable explanation, empty on success; the solver
        exception's text for ``"failed_solve"``.
    diagnostics:
        Extra per-evaluation values.  Empty for a plain
        :class:`FunctionProblem`.  A :class:`VmecProblem` adds the
        cumulative ``failed_trials`` and ``derivative_fallbacks`` counters,
        a ``solve_stats`` mapping when the implicit lane recorded one, and
        — when the equilibrium at ``x`` could be materialised — the summed
        force residual ``fsq``, its ``fsq_ratio`` to the solve tolerance,
        the configured ``max_fsq_ratio``, and the boolean
        ``derivative_certified``.  A failed solve also carries

class FunctionProblem:
    """A decision vector plus optimizer-compatible objective callables.

    Parameters are explicit and immutable from the caller's perspective.
    Supplying combined value/gradient or residual/Jacobian functions enables a
    one-entry exact-key cache, so the common SciPy call sequence does not repeat
    expensive work.  The cache is protected by a lock; JAX-native callables do
    not use host state and remain suitable for tracing.

    This class deliberately does not provide ``solve(method=...)``.  Pass its
    methods directly to the optimizer of choice.

    At least one of ``fun``, ``value_and_grad``, ``residual``, or
    ``residual_and_jac`` is required; every other callable is optional and
    the matching method raises :exc:`AttributeError` when its lane is
    absent.  The host callables receive one contiguous float NumPy array and
    are free to be opaque; the ``jax_*`` callables receive whatever the
    caller traces and must stay traceable.

    Two independent one-entry caches, each keyed on the exact bytes of ``x``
    (shape, dtype, and contents — no tolerance), avoid repeating work across
    the split calls an optimizer makes at one iterate.  The scalar cache is
    filled by :meth:`value_and_grad` and so covers ``value_and_grad`` alone,
    ``fun`` together with ``grad``, or ``residual_and_jac``.  The
    least-squares cache is filled by :meth:`residual_and_jac` and so covers
    ``residual_and_jac``, or ``residual`` together with ``residual_jac``.
    Whether the cache actually pays depends on which callables were
    supplied: with ``residual_and_jac``, SciPy's separate ``fun(x)`` then
    ``jac(x)`` calls both route through it and the second is free, whereas
    separately supplied ``residual`` and ``residual_jac`` are each invoked
    directly and share nothing.  Cached arrays are copied out, so a caller
    may mutate what it receives.  The caches are guarded by a re-entrant
    lock; the ``jax_*`` lane touches no host state and stays safe to trace.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0:
        Initial decision vector.  Copied to a float array; its size fixes
        the number of degrees of freedom and the expected Jacobian column
        count, and its shape is the shape gradients are reshaped to.
    fun:
        ``x -> float``, the scalar objective.  Called directly by
        :meth:`fun` without touching the cache.
    grad:
        ``x -> array``, the objective gradient.  Used only in combination
        with ``fun``; on its own it does not enable :meth:`grad`.
    value_and_grad:
        ``x -> (float, array)``.  The preferred scalar lane: it is one call
        for both quantities and it fills the scalar cache.  The method that
        serves it is also reachable under SciPy's ``fun_and_grad`` name.
    residual:
        ``x -> array``, the least-squares residual vector ``r(x)``.  It is
        flattened, and defines the scalar objective ``0.5 * r @ r`` when the
        problem has no scalar lane of its own (no ``fun``, ``grad``, or
        ``value_and_grad``).
    residual_jac:
        ``x -> array``, the Jacobian ``dr_i/dx_j``.  It must have one
        column per decision variable; anything else raises
        :exc:`ValueError`.
    residual_and_jac:
        ``x -> (array, array)``, the preferred least-squares lane: one call
        for both, filling the cache that :meth:`residual` and
        :meth:`residual_jac` then read.  The Jacobian shape is checked
        exactly against ``(r.size, x0.size)``.
    jax_fun, jax_value_and_grad, jax_residual, jax_residual_jac:
        Traceable counterparts of the four callables above, returned
        unwrapped by the matching ``jax_*`` methods.  They are never
        cached and never see host state, so they remain usable inside
        :func:`jax.jit` and :func:`jax.grad`.  ``jax_fun`` falls back to the
        first element of ``jax_value_and_grad`` when it is not supplied.
    names:
        One name per decision variable, in order, surfaced as
        :attr:`dof_names` for labelling output.  The default is
        ``x[0], x[1], ...``; a length other than ``x0.size`` raises
        :exc:`ValueError`.
    bounds:
        Box constraints stored verbatim for the optimizer to consume — a
        SciPy :class:`~scipy.optimize.Bounds`, or a ``(lower, upper)``
        pair.  This class neither interprets nor enforces them.
    scales:
        Positive finite per-variable scale factors with the shape of
        ``x0``, defaulting to ones.  Like ``bounds`` they are carried, not
        applied: pass them to the optimizer (SciPy's ``x_scale``).  A
        non-finite or non-positive entry raises :exc:`ValueError`.
    metadata:
        Free-form mapping copied onto the instance.  VMEX-built problems
        use it to carry the named residual slices, the solver
        configuration, the mutable solve counters, and the traceable
        state accessors that :class:`VmecProblem` reads.
    evaluation_progress:
        Print an elapsed-time heartbeat around long evaluations.  It stays
        silent until a call outlives the first interval, so fast calls
        print nothing.  It wraps the standalone :meth:`residual` and
        :meth:`residual_jac` calls only, which is where a production deck
        spends minutes; the combined and scalar lanes are unaffected.
    report_interval:
        Seconds between heartbeat lines.  Must be positive.

class VmecProblem(FunctionProblem):
    """A :class:`FunctionProblem` backed by a VMEX equilibrium solve.

    Adds the maps between the optimizer's decision vector and VMEC objects:
    the input deck, the converged equilibrium, and the boundary coefficient
    arrays.  It keeps the same optimizer contract as its base class, so the
    same methods go to SciPy, JAXopt, or Optax unchanged, and it enriches
    :meth:`evaluate` with the solve and adjoint status of the underlying
    equilibrium.

    Build one with :meth:`from_tuples`, :meth:`from_loss`, or
    :meth:`from_input` rather than calling this constructor: they route
    through ``vmex.core.optimize.make_problem``, which is what assembles the
    four callables below along with the objective, the derivative lane, the
    degree-of-freedom names, and the metadata.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args:
        Forwarded positionally to :class:`FunctionProblem`; in practice the
        decision vector ``x0``.
    **kwargs:
        Forwarded to :class:`FunctionProblem`: the objective callables,
        ``names``, ``bounds``, ``scales``, and ``metadata``.
    input_from_x:
        Required.  ``x -> VmecInput``: a new input deck carrying the
        boundary coefficients — and the current degrees of freedom, when
        the problem parameterizes them — of this decision vector.  Nothing
        is solved.
    x_from_input:
        Required.  The inverse, ``VmecInput -> array``: the decision vector
        that reproduces a given deck, which is the normal starting point of
        a continuation stage.  :meth:`x_from_input` rejects a result whose
        shape differs from ``x0``.
    equilibrium_from_x:
        Optional ``x -> Equilibrium``, the converged equilibrium at ``x``.
        Implicit problems return the accepted state the objective already
        computed rather than cold-solving the boundary again, which matters
        for strongly shaped boundaries whose cold axis guess can produce a
        sign-changing initial Jacobian.  ``None`` makes
        :meth:`equilibrium_from_x` raise :exc:`AttributeError`.  A callable
        that accepts a ``newton_iterations`` keyword receives it only when
        the caller asks for something other than the default 10, so a
        closure without that keyword still works.
    boundary_from_x:
        Optional ``x -> tuple of arrays``, the traceable boundary
        coefficients: ``(rbc, zbs)`` for a stellarator-symmetric input and
        ``(rbc, zbs, rbs, zbc)`` when ``lasym``.  Each is a full dense
        INDATA-layout array of shape ``(2 * ntor + 1, mpol)`` indexed
        ``[n + ntor, m]`` in metres — not the trimmed decision vector — and
        is a JAX array, so it composes with coil or surface objectives
        under :func:`jax.grad`.  ``None`` makes :meth:`boundary_from_x`
        raise :exc:`AttributeError`.

        """Build a VMEC least-squares problem from weighted objective tuples.

        The README entry point.  Each tuple is ``(function, target,
        weight)`` and contributes one or more rows to a single residual
        vector; the rows of all terms are concatenated in the order given
        and the scalar cost is ``0.5 * r @ r``.  Named row ranges are
        recorded in the problem metadata, which is what lets
        :class:`~vmex.core.monitoring.OptimizationMonitor` report per-term
        costs without re-solving anything.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inp:
            The starting :class:`~vmex.core.input.VmecInput`.  Its boundary
            supplies the initial decision vector and its resolution and
            profiles are held fixed apart from the parameterized degrees of
            freedom.
        objective_terms:
            The ``(function, target, weight)`` triples.

            ``function`` is normally a traceable
            ``function(state, runtime) -> scalar or vector``, evaluated on
            the converged equilibrium — the two arguments are also spelled
            ``(equilibrium_state, solver_context)``.  An objective *object*
            exposing a ``residuals_state`` method may be passed instead
            (whole instance or bound method), in which case its full
            pointwise residual vector becomes this term's rows.  Under
            ``derivative_method="finite_difference"`` a one-argument host
            callable taking the whole ``Equilibrium`` is accepted too; the
            implicit lane rejects it, since it cannot be traced.

            ``target`` is the value the term is driven toward, coerced with
            :func:`float`, so it must be scalar even when ``function``
            returns a vector — the same target is then subtracted from
            every row.

            ``weight`` is a non-negative scalar, or a one-dimensional array
            with one entry per residual row of that term.  Under the
            default ``weight_semantics="cost"`` it multiplies the squared
            cost, so the row is ``sqrt(weight) * (function - target)``;
            with ``weight_semantics="residual"`` the row is
            ``weight * (function - target)`` and a negative entry is then
            allowed.
        **kwargs:
            Passed through to ``vmex.core.optimize.make_problem``: which
            boundary modes vary (``max_mode``, ``vary_major_radius``,
            ``current_dofs``), the derivative lane
            (``derivative_method``, ``implicit_jacobian_method``,
            ``jacobian_batch_size``), the forward solve controls, the
            variable scaling (``use_ess``, ``ess_alpha``, ``bounds``), and
            ``weight_semantics``.

        Returns
        -------
        A :class:`VmecProblem` whose ``residual``/``residual_jac`` pair,
        ``x0``, and ``scales`` are ready for
        :func:`scipy.optimize.least_squares`.  A non-finite or empty
        residual at the initial point raises :exc:`FloatingPointError`
        rather than starting an optimization that cannot recover.
