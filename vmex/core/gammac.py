"""Differentiable fast-ion confinement proxy ``Gamma_c``.

``Gamma_c`` measures how far the contours of the second adiabatic invariant
``J`` deviate from flux surfaces: trapped particles whose bounce-averaged
drift has a radial component ride superbanana orbits out of the device, and
Velasco et al. 2021, eqs. (20)-(21), relate the prompt-loss fraction of
energetic ions approximately linearly to ``Gamma_c`` (more linearly still
to the ``|gamma_c*|`` variant).  The proxy
of Nemov, Kasilov, Kernbichler, Leitold, Phys. Plasmas 15, 052501 (2008),
equation 61, as organized by Velasco et al., Nucl. Fusion 61, 116059 (2021),
equation 16, is

.. math::

   \\gamma_c = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\arctan
     \\frac{v_r}{v_p},
   \\qquad
   \\Gamma_c = \\frac{\\pi}{4\\sqrt 2}\\left\\langle
     \\int_{1/B_{\\max}}^{1/B}\\!\\mathrm d\\lambda\\,
     \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{1-\\lambda B}}\\,\\gamma_c^2\\right\\rangle,

where :math:`v_r` and :math:`v_p` are the bounce-averaged radial and
poloidal-tangential projections of the magnetic drift
:math:`\\mathbf v_M \\propto (1-\\lambda B/2)\\,
\\mathbf B\\times\\nabla B/B^3`, bounce averages run between bounce points,
and :math:`\\langle\\cdot\\rangle` is the flux-surface average.  Expanded
over wells ``w`` along field lines this is evaluated as

.. math::

   \\Gamma_c = \\frac{\\pi}{8\\sqrt 2}\\,
     \\frac{\\int\\mathrm d\\lambda\\sum_w (v\\tau_b\\,\\gamma_c^2)_w}
          {\\int \\mathrm dl/B},

averaging numerator and denominator over the sampled field-line labels.

VMEX evaluates the drift ratio in Nemov's own form, using DESC's rewrite of
Nemov's equations 21-22 into single-valued maps of periodic quantities
(``desc.compute._fast_ion``, on the bounce kernel of Unalmis et al.,
J. Plasma Phys. 92(3), 2026, doi:10.1017/S0022377826101652):

.. math::

   \\tan\\frac{\\pi\\gamma_c}{2} =
   \\frac{\\int\\mathrm dl\\, w\\,
          (\\mathbf B\\times\\nabla B)\\cdot\\nabla\\psi/B^3}
        {\\big(|\\nabla\\rho|\\,\\Vert\\mathbf e_\\alpha\\Vert\\big)_{B_{\\min}}
         \\int \\mathrm dl\\,\\big[w\\,\\partial_\\rho B|_{\\vartheta,\\phi}
         + \\sqrt{1-\\lambda B}\\,K\\big]/B},

with :math:`w = (1-\\lambda B/2)/\\sqrt{1-\\lambda B}`, PEST angles
:math:`(\\vartheta,\\phi)`, :math:`\\rho=\\sqrt{s}`,
:math:`K = \\iota_\\rho\\,(\\nabla\\psi\\times\\mathbf b)\\cdot\\nabla\\phi
- 2\\,\\partial_\\rho B|_{\\vartheta,\\phi}
+ B\\,\\partial_\\rho B^\\phi|_{\\vartheta,\\phi}/B^\\phi`, and the
surface-tangency factor interpolated to the field minimum of each well.
Unlike the literal line-integral form of Velasco's equations 14-15, whose
poloidal drift carries a secular shear term that grows with the sampled
line length, this form is built from periodic quantities only and converges
as transits are added — the reason it is also DESC's default ``GammaC``
variant.  Velasco's :math:`\\gamma_c^*` differs from Nemov's only by the
tangency factor in the arctan argument (Velasco 2021, footnote to eq. 14).

Field lines are the PEST lines of :mod:`vmex.core.stability` /
:mod:`vmex.core.turbulence`; every geometric ingredient is an exact spectral
point evaluation with JAX AD, and the singular bounce integrals reuse the
drift kernels of :func:`vmex.core.bounce.bounce_action`.  Everything is jnp:
the proxy is traceable and differentiable end to end.  Stellarator-symmetric
states with ``iota != 0`` on the target surfaces only, inherited from the
field-line parameterization.

Two derivative semantics, named explicitly rather than switched by options:
:class:`GammaC` is the hard physical diagnostic — its *value* is the number
to report, but its discretized boundary derivative is exact-yet-divergent
under grid refinement (branch noise; the measured ladder is pinned in
``tests/test_gammac.py``) — and :class:`GammaCSmooth` is the optimization
surrogate: the same wells and quadrature with the two measured noise
structures (separatrix bounce-time curvature and superbanana drift-angle
corners) regularized on a fixed, annealable ``temperature`` scale, giving a
boundary derivative that is stable in sign and magnitude under the same
refinement ladder.  A matched-topology tracked variant
(``GammaCTracked``) can join them without changing either meaning.

    with the hard-branch noise sources of the discretized boundary
    derivative regularized on one scale ``delta`` (a quadrature parameter,
    held fixed under differentiation like the pitch grid):

    - **capped bounce kernels**: the inverse parallel speed becomes
      ``1/sqrt(max(1 - lambda B, 0) + delta)`` (the ``kernel_floor`` of
      :func:`vmex.core.bounce.bounce_action`).  Near a separatrix the exact
      bounce time diverges logarithmically in the reflecting level, so a
      pitch node landing at distance ``d`` from a barrier top contributes a
      ``1/d`` derivative term whose sign depends on which side the node
      fell — the sign-flipping refinement ladder measured for the hard
      gradient.  The floor caps that curvature at scale ``delta``, which
      the pitch grid resolves, so the discretized derivative converges;
    - the same floor also removes the hard **birth/death jump**: the exact
      bounce time of a well born at a quadratic ``|B|`` minimum starts at the
      finite oscillator period (amplitude-independent), so the hard value
      jumps when a boundary variation creates or destroys a well — the
      birth/death events of the well-connection graph of Ochs, J. Plasma
      Phys. (2025).  With the floor, a newborn well's bounce time is
      ``~ width/sqrt(delta) -> 0``, so wells fade in and out continuously.

    ``delta = temperature * (B_max - B_min)/B_max`` of the sampled lines —
    a fixed fraction of the trapped range, with softmax-weighted extrema so
    the scale is differentiable (see the note at its construction: freezing
    it under ``stop_gradient`` left the AD slope at 0.37x of the true FD
    slope of the objective, and the missing coherent term let branch noise
    set the through-the-solve sign).  Deliberately **not** tied to the grid
    spacings: a per-resolution ``delta`` makes every refinement rung
    differentiate a different functional, and the measured li383 ladder
    stayed sign-erratic that way; a fixed fraction converges (the
    regression test pins it).  The resolution must resolve the smoothing
    instead: ``num_pitch * temperature >~ 4`` keeps the pitch spacing
    inside ``delta`` (the default pairing 0.15 x 32 satisfies it).
    Annealing = re-optimizing at a lower ``temperature`` with a
    correspondingly finer budget; the surrogate converges to the hard
    ``Gamma_c`` in that joint limit.
