"""Backend (CPU/GPU) selection policy for the core solve lanes.

Measured basis: ``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`` (see its ``meta.notes`` for
the per-deck timings).  Per-iteration throughput favours the GPU (up to 3x
wall on NuhrenbergZille-class decks), but the GPU pays fixed per-solve
overheads (~0.2-0.4 s dispatch/transfer floor plus compile/cache-load on
cold processes), so small decks that converge in well under a second of CPU
work finish faster on the CPU.

The rule uses the per-iteration work proxy ``ns * mnmax * nznt`` (radial
surfaces x spectral modes x angular grid — the cost driver of the
``totzsps/tomnsps`` batched matmuls that dominate one ``funct3d`` pass).
The measured decks split into two clusters: work proxies up to ~24e3 where
the CPU wins and any misclassification costs < 0.5 s either way, and
proxies >= ~490e3 where the GPU wins by 2-3x.
:data:`GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK` = ``100_000`` sits between them (their
geometric mean is ~109e3).

Mode count is an independent guard: the measured GPU winners have at most
162 active Fourier modes, while a high-resolution HSX deck (``mnmax=858``)
ran ~3.4x *slower* on the GPU even warm, despite a large work proxy.
:data:`GPU_MAX_SPECTRAL_MODES` = 512 sits between the largest measured GPU
winner (288 modes) and that high-mode CPU winner; the intermediate range is
not calibrated, and the cutoff is not claimed as a hardware-independent
crossover — explicit placement remains available to measure newer hardware.

The policy is a *default* only: an explicit ``device=`` argument to
``solve``/``solve_multigrid`` always wins, while ``device=None`` follows
JAX placement.  The automatic policy stands down when the user selected a
JAX default device or platform themselves.
