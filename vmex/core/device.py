"""Backend (CPU/GPU) selection policy for the core solve lanes.

Measured basis: ``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`` (2026-07-09, 2x RTX A4000,
jax 0.6.2 cuda12) — see its ``meta.notes`` and commit ``a324f503``:

- Per-*iteration* throughput favours the GPU across the measured low- and
  moderate-mode legacy lane (0.83 ms vs 1.90 ms at
  ``ns=35, mpol=2, ntor=2``, up to 3x on NuhrenbergZille-class decks:
  90 s vs 277 s wall).
- The GPU pays fixed per-solve overheads (~0.2-0.4 s dispatch/transfer floor
  plus compile/cache-load on cold processes), so *small* decks that converge
  in well under a second of CPU work finish faster on the CPU
  (``solovev``: 0.043 s CPU vs 0.289 s CUDA warm wall; ``cth_like_fixed_bdy``:
  0.198 s vs 0.383 s).

The rule implemented here uses the per-iteration work proxy
``ns * mnmax * nznt`` (radial surfaces x spectral modes x angular grid — the
cost driver of the ``totzsps/tomnsps`` batched matmuls that dominate one
``funct3d`` pass):

NuhrenbergZille_1988_QHS (11*162*286)      509,652  276.9 / 90.1 s     gpu
======================================  ==========  =================  ======

Below :data:`GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK` the measured difference is < 0.5 s
either way (the ``*`` misclassification costs ~0.4 s); above it the GPU wins
by 2-3x within the measured low/moderate-mode cluster.  The threshold
``100_000`` sits between those two clusters (geometric mean of 24.3e3 and
491.5e3 ~ 109e3).

Mode count is an independent guard.  On the supplied high-resolution HSX
deck (``ns=101, mnmax=858, nznt=2200``), a same-host office measurement took
426.94 s on CPU versus 1468.07 s on an RTX A4000 after its persistent cache
was populated.  The conservative :data:`GPU_MAX_SPECTRAL_MODES` cutoff of 512
sits between the largest measured GPU winner (288 modes) and that high-mode
CPU winner.  The existing measured GPU winners have at most 162 modes; the
intermediate range is not calibrated.  The round cutoff preserves AUTO for
common stages through 288 modes while catching the measured HSX regression.
It is not claimed as a hardware-independent physical crossover; explicit
placement remains available for users to measure newer hardware.

The policy is a *default* only: an explicit ``device=`` argument to
``solve``/``solve_multigrid`` always wins, while ``device=None`` follows
JAX placement.  The automatic policy stands down when the user selected a
JAX default device or platform themselves.
