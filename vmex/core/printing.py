Replicates the iteration lines, multigrid stage banners, and termination
messages of VMEC2000 byte-for-column, so ``vmec input.x`` output can be
diffed against ``xvmec2000 input.x`` output structurally.

VMEC2000 counterparts: ``Sources/Input_Output/printout.f`` (iteration lines,
FORMATs 15/25/40/45/50/60/65/70), ``Sources/Initialization_Cleanup/
initialize_radial.f`` (FORMAT 1000, stage banner), ``Sources/TimeStep/
runvmec.f`` (FORMAT 30, force-iterations banner), and ``Sources/TimeStep/
eqsolve.f`` (FORMAT 110, vacuum banner).  The exact format strings are
recorded in Appendix B.

All functions return strings; the caller decides where they go (stdout, the
threed1 file, or a ``jax.debug.callback``).
