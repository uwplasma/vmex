    """Krylov controls and failure policy for polished-root derivatives.

    One tangent or one adjoint costs exactly one preconditioned GMRES solve of
    the ``(chart.size, chart.size)`` stationarity operator, so these five
    values set the entire linear cost and the entire accuracy of a polished
    derivative.  Convergence is not taken on the solver's word: the true
    residual ``||b - A x||`` is recomputed on the returned iterate and
    compared against ``max(atol, rtol * ||b||)``.  Every range below is
    enforced in ``__post_init__``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rtol:
        Relative tolerance on that true residual, dimensionless.  Must be
        finite and strictly positive.  The default is tight because a
        polished-root gradient is normally consumed by an optimizer that
        assumes exact derivatives.
    atol:
        Absolute floor on the same residual, in the units of the stationarity
        right-hand side (a cotangent of the collocation residual, so scaled
        force per chart coordinate).  Must be finite and nonnegative; ``0.0``
        is allowed and makes the test purely relative.
    restart:
        GMRES Arnoldi cycle length, i.e. how many Krylov vectors are kept
        before restarting.  Clamped down to the system size for small charts.
        Must be at least 1.
    max_restarts:
        Maximum restart cycles, so at most ``restart * max_restarts``
        iterations in total.  Must be at least 1.
    fail_policy:
        What a non-converged solve does.  ``"raise"`` raises
        :class:`~vmex.core.errors.StrongForceLinearSolveError` carrying the
        solve kind, iteration count, achieved residual, and tolerance;
        ``"nan"`` returns a NaN-filled result instead.  The check is a host
        check: under :func:`jax.jit` the values are tracers, so neither
        branch can run and the solve returns NaN where it did not converge
        regardless of the policy.  The report always comes back either way,
        so a traced caller can inspect ``report.converged`` itself.

    ----------
    context:
        The :class:`~vmex.core.polish_driver.PolishContext` of a certified
        polish, i.e. ``PolishResult.context``, surfaced by the solver as
        ``result.polish_context``.  It supplies the frozen runtime, chart, and
        stationary correction; the derivative is taken at exactly that point.
        A ``correction`` whose shape is not ``(chart.size,)`` is rejected.
    native_tangent:
        Perturbation of the unpolished native state, a pytree with the same
        structure as ``context.runtime.native`` (checked) and matching leaf
        shapes: the six ``(mnmax, nbasis)`` spline coefficient tables
        (``R``/``Z`` in metres, lambda in radians), the three ``(nbasis,)``
        profile leaves ``phipf``, ``chipf`` (flux derivatives with respect to
        normalized toroidal flux ``s``) and ``pressure`` (Pa), plus the
        boundary tables when the state carries them.  Typically the seed of an
        outer forward-mode derivative with respect to a shape or profile
        parameter.
    config:
        Krylov controls for the single linear solve.

    Returns
    -------
    A :class:`PolishTangentResult` whose ``native_tangent`` is the total
    tangent of the polished state, with the input's pytree structure and leaf
    shapes; whose ``correction_tangent`` is ``dc`` with shape
    ``(chart.size,)``; and whose ``report`` certifies the solve.  A
    non-converged solve follows ``fail_policy`` — it raises, or fills the
    response with NaN so the returned tangent is NaN as well.
