"""High-order toroidal reconstruction and an independent strong-force oracle.

This module deliberately does not call VMEX's legacy half-mesh force kernels.
It reconstructs smooth, axis-regular Fourier amplitudes with local splines,
forms the curvilinear metric at arbitrary points, and evaluates
``curl(B) / mu0 x B - grad(p)`` from the continuous representation.

Coordinates are ``(rho, theta, zeta)`` with ``s = rho**2`` and ``zeta`` the
field-period angle.  The physical cylindrical angle is ``zeta / nfp``.
Every Fourier amplitude is represented as ``rho**abs(m) q(s)``.

    and have shape ``S + (3,)``.  Coordinates are ``(rho, theta, zeta)`` with
    ``rho = sqrt(s)``, ``s = psi / psi_edge`` the normalised toroidal flux,

    latter is the Lorentz force generated by any cross-surface current

        dimensionless; ``theta`` and ``zeta`` are in radians.
    sqrt_g:
        ``det(d(x, y, z) / d(rho, theta, zeta))``, m^3 per radian^2.  This is
        the Jacobian of *these* coordinates: it equals ``2 * rho / nfp`` times

        Jacobian's sign -- the equilibrium's ``signgs``, recorded on the state
        as ``jacobian_sign``.
    B:
        Magnetic field in Cartesian components, T.
    J:
        Current density ``curl(B) / mu0`` in Cartesian components, A/m^2.
    force:
        ``J x B - grad(p)`` in Cartesian components, N/m^3.  Vanishing
        everywhere is exact ideal-MHD force balance.
    force_rho:
        Covariant radial force ``force . d(position)/d(rho)``, N/m^2;
        equivalently the signed coefficient of ``grad(rho)`` in ``force``.
    force_helical:
        ``sqrt_g * J^rho``, formed as
        ``(dB_zeta/dtheta - dB_theta/dzeta) / mu0``, in A.  Signed; it
        vanishes when the current stays inside the flux surfaces.
    radial_force_density:
        ``|force_rho * grad(rho)|``, N/m^3 -- the length of the radial part
        of ``force``.
    helical_force_density:
        Length of ``force_helical * (-B^zeta grad(theta) +
        B^theta grad(zeta))``, N/m^3.
    signed_radial_force_density:
        ``force_rho * |grad(rho)|``, N/m^3: ``radial_force_density`` keeping
        the sign of ``force_rho`` (outward versus inward imbalance).
    signed_helical_force_density:
        ``force_helical * |-B^zeta grad(theta) + B^theta grad(zeta)|``,
        N/m^3: ``helical_force_density`` keeping the sign of
        ``force_helical``.
    lorentz_norm:
        ``|J x B|``, N/m^3.
    grad_pressure_norm:
        ``|grad(p)|``, N/m^3.  With ``lorentz_norm`` it forms the pointwise
        denominator of the normalisation used by

    absolute_linf:
        Largest ``|J x B - grad(p)|`` over the grid nodes, N/m^3.
    normalized_l2, normalized_p99, normalized_linf:
        The same three statistics of the normalised pointwise residual;

        into the ``grad(rho)`` direction and the cross-surface-current

    near_axis_l2, bulk_l2, edge_l2:

        force_floor)`` between the reported quadrature order and one two
        orders lower; dimensionless.  Large values mean the residual is
        still quadrature-limited, so ``absolute_l2`` cannot be trusted.
    minimum_signed_jacobian:
        Smallest value over the grid of
        ``jacobian_sign * sqrt_g / max(rho, 1e-14)``, m^3 per radian^2.  The
        division removes the ``O(rho)`` vanishing of ``sqrt_g`` at the axis,
        so a positive value means the Jacobian never changed sign.
    nestedness_margin:
        ``min(jacobian_sign * sqrt_g / rho) / mean(|jacobian_sign * sqrt_g /
        rho|)`` over the grid; dimensionless.  Positive exactly when
        ``minimum_signed_jacobian`` is, but scale-free, so it is comparable
        across configurations and devices where the raw minimum is not.
    boundary_residual:
        Largest absolute difference, over all R/Z Fourier amplitudes, between
        the spline evaluated at ``s = 1`` and the boundary amplitudes stored
        on the state, m.  Zero when the state carries no boundary tables.
        Non-zero means the lift did not preserve the prescribed fixed
        boundary.
    gauge_residual:
        Largest absolute lambda spline coefficient in the ``(m, n) = (0, 0)``
        mode, radians.  The lift removes that gauge mode structurally, so
        anything but zero indicates a broken lift.
    global_normalizations, window_normalizations:
        :class:`ForceErrorNormalizations` of the residual over the whole
        domain and over the stated ``s`` window (``normalization_window`` of
        :func:`certify_strong_force`).  These volume-averaged ratios do not
        saturate the way the pointwise ``normalized_*`` entries do, so they
        are the numbers to quote for a polish gain.
    saturation:
        Human-readable statement of why ``normalized_*`` cannot exceed 2 and
        what a value near 2 means (a collapsed denominator, not a 200% force
        error); the module constant ``_SATURATION``.
    force_floor:
        The additive floor, N/m^3, placed in the normalisation denominator so
        that force-free, pressure-free points do not produce ``0 / 0``.
    normalization:
        Human-readable statement of the pointwise normalisation formula.
    coordinate_convention:
        Human-readable statement of the ``(rho, theta, zeta)`` convention the
        report was computed in.

    Builds a validation grid that no solver used and reduces

    on every spline span of ``state.radial_basis`` -- open, so ``rho = 0`` is
    never sampled -- with the quadrature order raised to
    ``degree + radial_order_increment + 1``.  Angularly it is a uniform grid
    of ``ntheta = max(8, 2 * angular_multiplier * (max(m) + 1))`` and
    ``nzeta = max(4, 2 * angular_multiplier * (max|n| + 1))`` points, offset
    by half and three-eighths of a cell so it never coincides with a
    collocation node.  Volume weights are ``|sqrt_g| drho dtheta dzeta``.

    ``radial_refinement_difference`` re-evaluates the whole grid at the
    coarser order ``max(degree + 1, order - 2)`` and reports the relative
    change in the volume residual, which is what makes the number a
    certificate rather than a reading: a residual that moves under
    refinement is quadrature-limited.

    ``angular_spectral_tail`` masks on the poloidal wavenumber magnitude
    ``|m|`` and on the non-negative toroidal index of the real FFT, so both
    contributions are genuine high-harmonic fractions; it is still a coarse
    under-resolution flag rather than a calibrated error.

    The acceptance criterion is the pointwise ``eps_F`` volume L2
    (``normalized_l2``), which is bounded above by 2 by construction.  The
    report also carries the volume-averaged normalizations of
    :class:`ForceErrorNormalizations` twice: over the whole domain, and over
    the flux window ``window`` (``s`` in ``[0.1, 0.99]`` by default), which
    excludes the coordinate-singular axis and the boundary layer at the edge
    where the raw maxima live.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state:
        The continuous equilibrium to certify.
    angular_multiplier:
        Angular overintegration factor relative to the state's own mode
        numbers, as in the ``ntheta``/``nzeta`` formulas above.  ``1`` is
        Nyquist for the reconstructed geometry; the default ``2`` doubles it
        so the quadratic force nonlinearity is resolved.
    radial_order_increment:
        Extra Gauss-Legendre points per spline span above the
        ``degree + 1`` that would integrate the basis exactly.
    force_floor:
        Additive floor in N/m^3 for the normalisation denominator and for
        the ``radial_refinement_difference`` denominator; keeps
        force-free, pressure-free points finite.
    window:
        The ``(s_min, s_max)`` flux window, ``0 <= s_min < s_max <= 1``, over
        which ``window_normalizations`` is averaged.

    Returns
    -------
    StrongForceReport
        Absolute (N/m^3) and normalised (dimensionless) residual statistics,
        the radial residual profiles on ``radial_nodes``, and the Jacobian,
        boundary and lambda-gauge checks.

    Draws two panels side by side.  The left panel is a semi-log plot of
    ``StrongForceReport.flux_surface_normalized_l2`` against
    ``radial_nodes`` -- the dimensionless residual profile in
    ``rho = sqrt(s)``, one line per report.  The right panel is a grouped
    log-scale bar chart of ``absolute_l2``, ``absolute_p99`` and
    ``absolute_linf`` in N/m^3, one group per report.

    A mapping produces an overlaid, reviewer-facing comparison; passing one
    report is shorthand for ``{"equilibrium": report}``.  Matplotlib is
    imported lazily so force evaluation itself stays a lightweight core API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reports:
        One :class:`StrongForceReport`, or a mapping from legend label to
        report.  Mapping order sets the line and bar-group order.
    title:
        Figure suptitle.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        The Matplotlib ``(figure, axes)`` pair, with ``axes`` the length-two
        array of the profile and bar-chart panels, so callers can restyle or
        save the figure themselves.

    ------
    ValueError
        If ``reports`` is an empty mapping.
