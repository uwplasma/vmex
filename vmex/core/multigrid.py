"""Coarse -> fine radial interpolation of the spectral state (multigrid).

VMEC2000: ``Sources/TimeStep/interp.f`` — when the ``NS_ARRAY`` ladder moves
to the next radial resolution, the converged spectral coefficients ``xc`` are
interpolated linearly in radius onto the new grid with a VMEC-specific
convention (VMEC++ performs the same linear interpolation of the spectral
coefficients over the ``sqrt(s)``-scaled internal representation):

1. scale the coefficients by ``scalxc`` (``profil3d.f``) so odd-m harmonics
   enter in VMEC's internal ``1/sqrt(s)`` representation — linear in
   ``sqrt(s)`` near the axis;
2. extrapolate odd-m modes to the axis on the *scaled* array,
   ``x(js=1) = 2*x(js=2) - x(js=3)`` (Fortran 1-based);
3. interpolate linearly between the bracketing coarse surfaces using
   ``interp.f``'s ``js1/js2/xint`` uniform-grid construction;
4. divide by ``scalxc`` on the fine grid to return unscaled (internal
   physical) coefficients — the state enters and exits WITHOUT the ``scalxc``
   factor, exactly like the solver's :class:`~vmex.core.solver.SpectralState`;
5. zero odd-m coefficients on the output axis row (edge convention
   ``sqrts(ns) = 1`` is built into ``scalxc``).

The interpolation acts on the m = 1-*constrained* internal coefficients that
:mod:`vmex.core.solver` evolves (``interp.f`` interpolates the internal
``xc``, which is in the constrained basis): every step above is a per-mode
linear map that mixes only coefficients with the same poloidal mode number
``m``, so it commutes with the signed-(m, n) packing and with the m = 1
constraint rotation, and no basis conversion is required.

Math ported from the parity-proven legacy port
``vmex/multigrid.py`` (``interp_vmec_radial_coeffs``).  Pure JAX,
jit-compatible (``ns_coarse``/``ns_fine`` are static shape information), no
host round-trips of traced values.

    """Fixed-boundary multigrid solve over the ``NS_ARRAY`` ladder.

    VMEC2000 ``Sources/TimeStep/runvmec.f``: for each grid ``igrid`` the
    radial resolution ``nsval = ns_array(igrid)`` is solved with tolerance
    ``ftol_array(igrid)`` and iteration cap ``niter_array(igrid)``; stages
    stop at the first decreasing entry during ``readin.f`` normalization
    (equal entries re-run), and each executed stage after the first starts from the
    ``interp.f`` coarse -> fine interpolation (:func:`interpolate_state`) of
    the previous stage's final state.  Although ``initialize_radial.f`` reads
    ``xstore``, ``allocate_ns.f`` first overwrites it from the old ``xc``;
    therefore the effective VMEC2000 continuation source is the final
    iterate, including when the preceding stage exhausts NITER.  The time
    step resets to the input
    ``DELT`` at every stage, and each stage prints its own ``NS = ...``
    banner (``verbose=True``, ``mode="cli"``).

    ``ns_array/ftol_array/niter_array`` default to the input's ladder; when
    given they are broadcast to a common stage count (shorter ``ftol/niter``
    arrays repeat their last entry).  ``initial_state`` seeds the *first*
    executed stage (hot restart).  Its radial resolution may differ: VMEX
    interpolates the state before adapting its edge to the new boundary.

    ``restart_from`` (mutually exclusive with ``initial_state``) seeds the
    ladder from any restart source — a ``wout_*.nc`` path (VMEX- or
    VMEC2000/PARVMEC-written), a :class:`~vmex.core.wout.WoutData`, a
    previous :class:`~vmex.core.solver.SolveResult`, or a
    :class:`~vmex.core.solver.SpectralState`
    (:func:`vmex.core.restart.restart_state`).  Ladder policy
    (:func:`vmex.core.restart.skip_ladder_rungs`): every leading rung whose
    ``ns`` the seed already meets or exceeds is **skipped** — those rungs
    exist only to build a seed the caller already has; rungs above the seed
    resolution still run from the ``interp.f`` interpolant of the seed, and
    a seed finer than the whole ladder runs only the final rung (resampled
    down).  VMEC++ instead requires ``ns_array[0]`` to equal the source
    resolution.
    ``precon_type``, ``prec2d_threshold``, and ``prec2d`` override the input's
    optional 2D-preconditioner configuration at every stage.
    ``jacobian_retries`` applies the same bounded best-checkpoint/``DELT``
    recovery as :func:`vmex.core.solver.solve` independently at each stage;
    zero preserves VMEC2000's immediate fatal stop after 75 resets.
    If the first requested grid still has an invalid initial Jacobian after
    its magnetic-axis re-guess, ``coarse_grid_retry=True`` retries the ladder
    once with an automatic ``ns=3``, ``ftol=1e-4`` stage prepended.  This is
    the current VMEC++ driver recovery: it supplies a coarse equilibrium for
    interpolation without changing the user's requested stages.  Set it to
    false to expose the original typed failure directly.

    Intermediate stages are allowed to exhaust their iteration cap
    (``more_iter_flag`` — VMEC2000 proceeds to the next grid); any other
    failure raises immediately, and the final stage must converge
    (:class:`~vmex.core.errors.VmecConvergenceError` otherwise), exactly
    like :func:`vmex.core.solver.solve`.  With
    ``raise_on_max_iterations=False`` a final stage that merely hits NITER
    returns its last state instead (``converged=False``, ``ier_flag =
    more_iter_flag``).  This exposes the state to callers; the CLI writes it
    only when ``LFULL3D1OUT=T``, matching the VMEC2000 driver policy.

    Executable reuse: stage runtimes are structural pytrees (solver.py), so
    one XLA executable is compiled per distinct stage structure ``(ns,
    ftol, niter, ...)`` per session, and repeated ladders (parameter scans,
    hot restarts) recompile nothing.  Full radial padding to
    ``max(ns_array)`` — ONE executable for all stages — would need masked
    radial reductions through geometry/fields/forces/preconditioner and is
    not attempted here.

    ``device`` places each stage's jitted lanes (see
    :func:`vmex.core.solver.solve`): an explicit ``"cpu"``/``"gpu"``/
    ``jax.Device`` is always honored; ``"auto"`` (default) applies the
    measured per-stage policy of :mod:`vmex.core.device`, while ``None``
    follows JAX placement.  Auto never overrides an active JAX device or
    platform selection.

    ``use_fft`` has the same measured-hardware default and implicit-AD role as in
    :func:`vmex.core.solver.solve`.

    ``release_stage_cache=True`` clears JAX's in-memory compilation/staging
    caches between distinct radial grids. This lowers peak RSS for a one-shot
    high-resolution ladder while leaving the persistent on-disk cache intact.
    It is false by default so repeated library solves retain warm executables;
    the standalone CLI enables it.

    ``prefetch_compile=True`` (False by default: a library call must not
    spawn background compile threads implicitly — concurrent prefetching
    workers can exhaust CI-runner memory; the standalone CLI enables it)
    overlaps compilation with iteration on cold runs: while rung k
    iterates, a background thread AOT-compiles rung k+1's block-lane
    executable (the ladder is known up front).  Cache
    warming only — results are bit-identical, and any prefetch failure falls
    back silently to on-demand compilation.  The prefetch thread is joined
    *before* the ``release_stage_cache`` point, and the prefetched
    executable is held as a standalone object, so releasing rung k's caches
    cannot evict rung k+1's just-built executable.  Only the ``mode="cli"``
    block lane is prefetched, and equal-structure reruns (same ``ns``,
    ``ftol``, ``niter``) skip the prefetch because the previous rung's
    executable is reused directly.

    Returns the final stage's :class:`~vmex.core.solver.SolveResult`.

    """Free-boundary solve over the VMEC2000 ``NS_ARRAY`` ladder.

    The plasma continuation follows :func:`solve_multigrid`: each increasing
    grid starts from ``interp.f`` interpolation of the preceding stage's final
    state, equal grids rerun without interpolation, and the ladder stops at
    the first decreasing entry.  The external field is loaded once.  Resolution-
    specific NESTOR bases, Green-function programs, axis-current filament
    tables and traced vacuum loops are selected/rebuilt when the radial grid
    changes; equal-grid reruns reuse their dynamic vacuum cache.

    VMEC2000 carries ``ivac`` between grids.  Consequently, after vacuum has
    activated on a coarse stage, the next stage begins with vacuum active and
    uses the carried coarse-grid boundary pressure on iteration 1, then performs
    a full vacuum update on iteration 2 with new caches (no second turn-on
    banner or soft restart).  The prior stage's ``fsqr/fsqz/fsql`` values are
    retained too, matching ``initialize_radial.f`` and its first-pass
    ``residue.f90`` edge gate.  If an intermediate stage reaches ``NITER``
    before activation, the next stage continues in the pre-activation lane.

    ``initial_state`` hot-starts the first executed stage and is interpolated
    when its radial shape differs from that stage.  It follows reset-file
    semantics: the first stage repeats vacuum activation, while subsequent
    radial stages carry it.

    ``restart_from`` (mutually exclusive with ``initial_state``) accepts any
    restart source — a ``wout_*.nc`` path, :class:`~vmex.core.wout.WoutData`,
    :class:`~vmex.core.solver.SolveResult`, or
    :class:`~vmex.core.solver.SpectralState` — with the same ladder
    rung-skipping policy as :func:`solve_multigrid`
    (:func:`vmex.core.restart.skip_ladder_rungs`).  A wout written by a
    previous free-boundary run carries its converged free edge, which this
    path preserves (the seed is not clamped to the input boundary).
    The fixed-boundary ladder's solver controls (``time_step``, ``tcon0``,
    ``gamma``, ``nstep``, ``lconm1``, device placement, and 2D-preconditioner
    configuration) are accepted and forwarded identically, including bounded
    ``jacobian_retries`` recovery (zero restores the VMEC2000 fatal policy).
    ``coarse_grid_retry`` provides the same one-time ``ns=3`` recovery as the
    fixed-boundary ladder when the first requested grid retains an invalid
    Jacobian after its axis re-guess; vacuum activation restarts cleanly.
    ``device="auto"`` (default) applies the measured policy independently at
    each grid and relocates carried plasma/vacuum arrays when the policy changes;
    ``None`` leaves placement to JAX.
    The final stage's publishable potential and surface fields are retained in
    ``result.vacuum``; internal NESTOR matrix caches are not exposed.

    ``prefetch_compile=True`` (False by default, exactly like
    :func:`solve_multigrid`: a library call must not spawn background
    compile threads implicitly) overlaps compilation with iteration on cold
    runs.  A free-boundary rung selects among several lanes (first force
    pass, pre-activation loop, fused NESTOR update, turn-on pass, batched
    steady-state vacuum loop) and only the activation *iteration* is
    runtime-dependent — every lane *structure* is known once the rung's
    runtimes exist.  Two overlaps therefore apply (see
    ``freeboundary._launch_free_lane_prefetch``): within each rung, the
    post-entry lanes compile in the background while the entry lanes
    compile/iterate on the main thread; across rungs, the next rung's whole
    lane set compiles while the current rung iterates.  Cache warming only —
    results are bit-identical, any prefetch failure falls back silently to
    on-demand compilation, and background threads are joined before the
    ``release_stage_cache`` point exactly like the fixed-boundary ladder.
