"""2D block preconditioner: a matrix-free Newton step via ``jax.jvp`` + SOLVAX.

VMEC2000 counterpart
--------------------
``Sources/Hessian/precon2d.f`` — VMEC2000's optional 2D (``ictrl_prec2d``)
preconditioner.  It builds the full block-tridiagonal-in-radius Hessian of the
1D-preconditioned force map ``gc = g(xc)`` by finite-difference "jogs" of every
``(mode, type)`` column (``compute_blocks``), LU-factors it with BCYCLIC
(``blk3d_factor``), and in ``residue`` replaces the force by the block-solve
``gc <- -H^{-1} gc`` (``block_precond``, where ``H = d gc / d xc``).  This is a
Newton step on the already-1D-preconditioned residual; it converges stiff cases
(high beta, high aspect, high mode number) in far fewer iterations than the 1D
radial preconditioner alone.  Activation (``evolve.f``): finest grid only, once
``fsqr + fsqz + fsql < prec2d_threshold`` and ``iter2 >= 10``.

Modern (JAX) approach
---------------------
The forces are already traceable, so we get **exact** Hessian-vector products
for free from ``jax.jvp`` — no finite-difference jogs, no assembled blocks, no
BCYCLIC factorization.  Let ``g`` be the 1D-preconditioned force map
``state -> gc`` (frozen ``ns4`` cache — the 1D operator is a fixed linear
preconditioner during the Newton solve).  The Newton direction that drives
``g -> 0`` is

    delta = -J^{-1} g,     J = d g / d state   (block-tridiagonal in radius),

obtained by solving ``J delta = -g`` with **matrix-free GMRES**
(:func:`solvax.gmres`) whose matvec is ``v -> jvp(g, state, v)``.  Because the
1D preconditioner is baked into ``g`` (and hence into both ``J`` and the
right-hand side ``-g``), the ``M_1D^{-1}`` factor cancels exactly out of the
solve: ``delta`` is the *same* full Newton step ``-(dF/dstate)^{-1} F`` on the
raw force ``F`` regardless of the 1D operator — the 1D preconditioner only
accelerates GMRES (it makes ``J`` close to the identity near equilibrium, where
``M_1D`` approximates ``dF/dstate``).  This matches ``block_precond``'s sign:
``gc_out = -H^{-1} gc`` with ``H = d gc / d xc`` (``precon2d.f`` factorization
check ``block_dsave * x = -gc_save``).

The module is deliberately VMEC-agnostic: :func:`newton_direction` takes any
pytree-valued force map and a linearization point, so it is unit-testable
against a dense reference (``tests/core_new/test_preconditioner_2d.py``) and
could equally drive the block-tridiagonal :func:`solvax.block_thomas_truncated`
route if the blocks were assembled explicitly (they are not, by design — the
matrix-free HVP keeps peak memory at one force graph).

Wiring lives in :mod:`vmec_jax.core.solver` (``_make_body``): when
``precon_type != "NONE"`` the traced iteration replaces the 1D force direction
by :func:`newton_direction` under a ``lax.cond`` gated on the activation
predicate, so the default 1D-only path is untouched.

The solver packs only entries that Richardson can physically evolve. Fixed
R/Z boundary rows, axis-null harmonics, lambda-axis values, and zero/gauge
modes are excluded from GMRES and reconstructed with zero Newton updates.
This avoids singular or nonphysical columns without changing the force map.

    Attributes
    ----------
    threshold:
        Activate the Newton step once ``fsqr + fsqz + fsql < threshold`` on the
        finest grid (VMEC2000 ``prec2d_threshold`` / ``evolve.f``).  The default
        input value ``1e-30`` means "never" — the caller supplies a finite
        threshold to switch it on.
    start_iteration:
        Earliest iteration at which the Newton step may activate (VMEC2000
        skips the first 10 iterations: ``IF (iter2 < 10) ictrl_prec2d = 0``).
    step:
        Damping applied to the (full) Newton step, ``state += step * delta``.
        ``1.0`` is the undamped Newton update; VMEC2000 instead folds the step
        into its second-order Richardson stepper with ``time_step = 0.5``.
    gmres_restart:
        Arnoldi cycle size ``m`` of the inner GMRES (clamped to the problem
        size for tiny cases).
    gmres_max_restarts:
        Maximum number of GMRES restart cycles (outer iterations).
    gmres_rtol, gmres_atol:
        Inner GMRES tolerances on ``||b - J delta||``.  A loose ``rtol`` gives
        an *inexact* Newton step (cheaper, still super-linear far from the
        asymptotic regime); tighten for a near-exact step.
    finest:
        Whether this runtime is the finest multigrid stage (VMEC2000
        ``ns == ns_maxval``).  Single-grid solves are always finest; only the
        last multigrid stage sets this ``True``.
