"""Backend (CPU/GPU) selection policy for the core solve lanes.

Measured basis: ``benchmarks/gpu_baseline.json`` (2026-07-09, 2x RTX A4000,
jax 0.6.2 cuda12) — see its ``meta.notes`` and commit ``a324f503``:

- Per-*iteration* throughput favours the GPU at every tested size in the
  legacy lane (0.83 ms vs 1.90 ms at ``ns=35, mpol=2, ntor=2``, up to 3x on
  NuhrenbergZille-class decks: 90 s vs 277 s wall).
- The GPU pays fixed per-solve overheads (~0.2-0.4 s dispatch/transfer floor
  plus compile/cache-load on cold processes), so *small* decks that converge
  in well under a second of CPU work finish faster on the CPU
  (``solovev``: 0.043 s CPU vs 0.289 s CUDA warm wall; ``cth_like_fixed_bdy``:
  0.198 s vs 0.383 s).

The rule implemented here uses the per-iteration work proxy
``ns * mnmax * nznt`` (radial surfaces x spectral modes x angular grid — the
cost driver of the ``totzsps/tomnsps`` batched matmuls that dominate one
``funct3d`` pass):

======================================  ==========  =================  ======

solovev (11*6*10)                              660  0.043 / 0.289 s    cpu

LandremanPaul2021_QA (16*128*240)          491,520  14.54 / 4.19 s     gpu
NuhrenbergZille_1988_QHS (11*162*286)      509,652  276.9 / 90.1 s     gpu
======================================  ==========  =================  ======

Below :data:`GPU_MIN_ITERATION_WORK` the measured difference is < 0.5 s
either way (the ``*`` misclassification costs ~0.4 s); above it the GPU wins
by 2-3x and increasingly more with size.  The threshold ``100_000`` sits
between the two clusters (geometric mean of 24.3e3 and 491.5e3 ~ 109e3).

The policy is a *default* only: an explicit ``device=`` argument to
``solve``/``solve_multigrid`` always wins, and when the user pinned the JAX
platform themselves (``JAX_PLATFORMS``/``JAX_PLATFORM_NAME``) the automatic
policy stands down entirely (:func:`resolve_device` returns ``None``).

    GMRES solves (each with control flow), one per boundary Fourier dof — whose
    XLA compile grows with the dof count and whose evaluation is kernel-launch

    *slower* on the GPU than on the CPU at every optimization size tested: a

    37 min on the GPU, versus minutes on the CPU; the forward solve itself is a

    - otherwise pin to the CPU when the default backend is an accelerator, or
      leave placement untouched (``None``) when already on the CPU.
